(8) The use of specific electronic formats for the submission of insider lists as determined by competent authorities should also decrease the administrative burden for competent authorities, issuers, emission allowance market participants, auction platforms, auctioneers or auction monitor and those acting on their behalf or on their account. The electronic formats should allow for the information included in the insider list to be kept confidential and for the rules laid down in Union legislation on the processing of personal data and the transfer of such data to be complied with.
