(9) Since issuers on an SME growth market are exempted however from drawing up and keeping insider lists up to date and, therefore, may produce and keep that information on a format other than an electronic format as required by this Regulation to the rest of issuers, it is necessary not to impose on issuers on an SME growth market the requirement of using an electronic format for submitting the insiders lists to competent authorities. Likewise, it is also appropriate not to require the submission of certain personal data where such data is not available to those issuers at the moment the insider list is requested. Insider lists should be in any case submitted in a way that ensures the completeness, confidentiality and integrity of the information.
