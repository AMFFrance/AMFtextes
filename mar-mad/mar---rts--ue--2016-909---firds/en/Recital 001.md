(1) Commission Delegated Regulation to be adopted in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 27(3) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) requires ongoing submissions of identifying reference data for financial instruments admitted to trading. By contrast, Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 requires trading venues to notify their competent authorities only once of details of financial instruments which are the subject of a request for admission to trading, admitted to trading or traded and once subsequently where a financial instrument ceases to be traded or admitted to trading. Subject to the foregoing difference in reporting obligations under Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 and the aforementioned Delegated Regulation, the reporting obligations under this Regulation should be aligned with the reporting obligations under the aforementioned Delegated Regulation so as to reduce the administrative burden for entities subject to such obligations.
