(8) Certain examples of practices set out in this Regulation describe cases that are included in the notion of market manipulation or that, in some respects, refer to manipulative conduct. On the other hand, certain examples of practices may be considered legitimate if, for instance, a person who enters into transactions or issues orders to trade which may be deemed to constitute market manipulation may be able to establish that his reasons for entering into such transactions or issuing orders to trade were legitimate and in conformity with an accepted practice on the market concerned.
