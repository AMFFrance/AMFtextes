(8) On 25 May 2016, the Commission notified ESMA of its intention to endorse the draft implementing technical standard with amendments to account for the fact that the disclosure provisions in Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 are sufficient to ensure that emission allowance market participants disclose inside information publicly, effectively and in a timely manner, as required by Article 17(2) of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014. Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1348/2014 (3) already obliges emission allowance market participants to provide ‘web feeds’ for the website-based disclosures to be made public, effectively and in a timely manner. In its formal opinion of 16 June 2016, ESMA confirmed its initial position and did not resubmit an implementing technical standard amended in a way consistent with the Commission's proposed amendments. Since the disclosure requirements for emission allowance market participants under Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 may be sufficient for the purpose of complying with the requirements in Article 17(2) of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, the draft implementing technical standard should be amended to avoid duplicative reporting requirements.
