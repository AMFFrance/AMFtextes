(1) Disclosing market participants are to keep records of the communications of information taking place for the purposes of the market soundings between themselves and all persons receiving the market soundings. Such records should assist disclosing market participants in providing evidence of proper conduct to the competent authorities, in particular where the nature of the information changes after the market sounding or where the competent authority needs to review the process of categorisation of the information. To that end, all such records should be kept in an electronic format.
