(4) Market practices that can be established by competent authorities as AMPs can be different in type and nature. When establishing a market practice as an AMP, a competent authority should assess the frequency of the disclosure required from all the persons who will perform it to ensure it is adapted and appropriate to the market practice under consideration. The frequency of disclosure should achieve a balance between the need to inform the public and to provide the competent authority with information for the on-going monitoring and the burden to periodically disclose information by those performing the AMP. Moreover, when assessing a market practice that may be performed outside a trading venue, competent authorities should consider whether the requirement for a substantial level of transparency to the market is met.
