(1) Persons reporting actual or potential infringements of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 (whistle-blowers) to competent authorities may bring new information to the attention of competent authorities and assist the latter in detecting and imposing sanctions for market abuse offences. However, whistleblowing of infringements may be deterred by fear of retaliation, discrimination or disclosure of personal data. Adequate arrangements regarding whistleblowing are hence necessary to ensure the overall protection and the respect of the fundamental rights of the whistle-blowers and the accused persons. Persons who knowingly report wrong or misleading information to competent authorities should not be considered as whistle-blowers and thus should not enjoy the protection mechanisms.
