(7) The criteria described in this Regulation should be designed so that the assessment of one derivative or classes of derivatives may be compared with other derivatives or classes of derivatives with similar characteristics. The identification of classes of derivatives with similar characteristics may include a number of elements such as the currency in which they are traded, maturity dates, the starting term of the contracts' tenor, whether they follow a standard convention or not, and whether they are on-the-run contracts.
