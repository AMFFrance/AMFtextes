(3) Given the similarity of the definition of a liquid market for non-equities under point 17(a) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 to the criteria for determining whether a class of derivatives or subset thereof is sufficiently liquid under Article 32(3) of that Regulation, the assessment undertaken for one should be taken into consideration for the other to promote consistency in the treatment of instruments. However, a class of derivatives or subset thereof deemed to have a liquid market for transparency purposes should not be deemed automatically to be sufficiently liquid for the trading obligation. The quantitative thresholds and qualitative weightings may differ, taking into account the different objectives of the assessments.
