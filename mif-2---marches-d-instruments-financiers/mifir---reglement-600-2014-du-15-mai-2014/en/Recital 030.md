(30) Competent authorities should notify ESMA of the details of any of their requests to reduce a position in relation to a derivative contract, of any one-off limits, as well as of any ex-ante position limits in order to improve coordination and convergence in how those powers are applied. The essential details of any ex-ante position limits applied by a competent authority should be published on ESMAâ€™s website.
