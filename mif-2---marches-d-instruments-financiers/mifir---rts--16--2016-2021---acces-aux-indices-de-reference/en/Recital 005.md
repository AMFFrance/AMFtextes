(5) Although the values of two benchmarks could be highly correlated, particularly in the short run, their compositions or methodology could be fundamentally different. The long run correlation and similarities in the composition and the methodology of each of the benchmarks should therefore be taken into account for assessing whether a benchmark is new. Considering the heterogeneity of benchmarks, in addition to the factors laid down in this Regulation, a person with proprietary rights to a benchmark should also take into account additional factors, considering standards in use, that are specific to the type of benchmark concerned. For commodity benchmarks other factors should be assessed, including whether the relevant benchmarks are based on different underlying commodities and different delivery locations.
