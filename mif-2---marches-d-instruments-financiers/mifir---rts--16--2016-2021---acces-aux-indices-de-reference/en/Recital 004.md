(4) The way a benchmark is assessed as new or not will vary on a case by case basis. The person with proprietary rights to a benchmark should therefore demonstrate in what way that benchmark is new, if that is invoked as the reason for denying immediate access. Each assessment of a declared new benchmark should consider a combination of various factors and their appropriate weightings and not rely on a single factor to assess whether or not the benchmark meets the criteria specified in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014.
