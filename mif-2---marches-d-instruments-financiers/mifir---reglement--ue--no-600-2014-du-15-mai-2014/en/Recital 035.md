(35) Double reporting of the same information should be avoided. Reports submitted to trade repositories registered or recognised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 for the relevant financial instruments which contain all the required information for transaction reporting purposes should not need to be reported to competent authorities, but should be transmitted to them by the trade repositories. Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 should be amended to that effect.
