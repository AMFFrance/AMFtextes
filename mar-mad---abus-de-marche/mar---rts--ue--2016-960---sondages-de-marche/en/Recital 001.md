(1) Appropriate arrangements, procedures and record keeping requirements are necessary to ensure that market sounding activities are managed and controlled effectively. As part of the appropriate arrangements, disclosing market participants should establish procedures describing the manner in which market soundings are conducted. Such procedures should set out a standard set of information to be provided to and requested from the persons receiving the market sounding, ensuring that no unnecessary potentially sensitive information is disseminated and that all the persons receiving the market sounding receive the same level of information.
