(2) It is necessary to provide certainty as to the content of the information communicated in the course of market soundings. Therefore, where the market soundings are conducted by telephone and the disclosing market participant has access to recorded telephone lines, the disclosing market participant should use those lines. Where market soundings are conducted through channels other than by recorded telephone lines, records of the market sounding communications should be kept in the form of audio or video recordings or in written form. For personal data protection reasons, when the market sounding is made by recorded telephone lines or audio or video recording is being used, a consent to the recording should be obtained from the person receiving the market sounding.
