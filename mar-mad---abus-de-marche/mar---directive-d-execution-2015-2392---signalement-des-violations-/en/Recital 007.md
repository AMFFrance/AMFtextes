(7) Member States should ensure that competent authorities have in place adequate protection procedures for the processing of reports of infringements and reported persons' personal data. Such procedures should ensure that the identity of every reporting and reported person is protected at all stages of the procedure. This obligation should be without prejudice to the necessity and proportionality of the obligation to disclose information when this is required by Union or national law and subject to appropriate safeguards under such laws, including in the context of investigations or judicial proceedings or to safeguard the freedoms of others, including the rights of defence of the reported person.
