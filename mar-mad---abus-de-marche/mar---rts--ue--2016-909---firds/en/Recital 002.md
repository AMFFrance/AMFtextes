(2) In order to enable effective and efficient use of the list of notifications of financial instruments, trading venues should provide complete and accurate notifications of financial instruments. For the same reasons, competent authorities should monitor and assess notifications of financial instruments received from trading venues for completeness and accuracy and promptly inform them of any incompleteness or inaccuracy identified. Likewise, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) should monitor and assess the completeness and accuracy of notifications received from competent authorities and promptly inform them of any incompleteness or inaccuracy identified.
