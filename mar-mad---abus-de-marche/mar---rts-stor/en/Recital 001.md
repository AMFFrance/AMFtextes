(1) It is necessary to specify appropriate requirements for the arrangements, procedures and systems that market operators and investment firms operating a trading venue and any person professionally arranging or executing transactions should have in place for the reporting of orders and transactions that could constitute insider dealing, market manipulation or attempted insider dealing or market manipulation under Regulation (EU) No 596/2014. Such requirements should assist the prevention and detection of market abuse. They should also assist in ensuring that notifications submitted to competent authorities are meaningful, comprehensive and useful. In order to ensure that detection of market abuse is effective, appropriate systems should be in place to monitor orders and transactions. Such systems should provide for human analysis carried out by appropriately trained staff. The systems for monitoring market abuse should be capable of producing alerts in line with predefined parameters in order to allow for further anaysis to be conducted on potential insider dealing, market manipulation or attempted insider dealing or market manipulation. The whole process is likely to require some level of automation.
