(24) With regard to transactions made under or related to employee share or saving scheme, qualification or entitlement of shares it must be established whether they can be permitted by the issuer. Therefore, certain types of transactions should be clearly identified and determined in detail. The characteristics of such transactions relate to the nature of the transaction (e.g. a purchase or sale, exercise of option or other entitlements), the timing of the transaction or of the entering of the person discharging managerial responsibilities into a particular scheme, and whether the transaction and its characteristics (e.g. execution date, amount) was agreed, planned and organised a reasonable period before the closed period starts.
