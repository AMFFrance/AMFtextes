(7) A proportionate approach should be followed, taking into consideration the nature and specific characteristics of the financial instruments and markets concerned. The examples may be linked to and illustrate one or more indicators of market manipulation as provided in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 596/2014. As a result, a specific practice may involve more than one indicator of market manipulation laid down in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 depending on how it is used, and there can be some overlap. Similarly, although not specifically referenced in this Regulation, certain other practices may illustrate each of the indicators set out in this Regulation. Therefore, market participants and competent authorities should take into account other unspecified circumstances that could be considered to be potential market manipulation in accordance with the definition set out in Regulation (EU) No 596/2014.
