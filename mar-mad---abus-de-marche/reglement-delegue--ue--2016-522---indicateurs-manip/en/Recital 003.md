(3) An exemption from the scope of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 for operations undertaken in the public interest may, in accordance with Article 6(5) of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, be extended to certain public bodies charged with, or intervening in, public debt management and to central banks of third countries when they fulfil the relevant requirements. For that purpose, the Commission prepared and presented to the European Parliament and to the Council a report assessing the international treatment of certain public bodies charged with, or intervening in, public debt management and of central banks in third countries. The report included a comparative analysis of the treatment of certain bodies and central banks within the legal framework of third countries, and the risk management standards applicable to the transactions entered into by those public bodies and central banks in those jurisdictions. The report concluded in the comparative analysis the appropriateness of the extension of the exemption for transactions, orders or behaviour, in pursuit of monetary, exchange rate or public debt management policy, also to certain public bodies and central banks of those third countries.
