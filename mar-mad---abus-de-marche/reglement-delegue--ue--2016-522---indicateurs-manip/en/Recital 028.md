(28) The obligation to notify transactions conducted by persons discharging managerial responsibilities or a person closely associated with them applies to a broad spectrum of operations, and includes every transaction conducted on their own account. Therefore, it is appropriate to identify a broad non-exhaustive list of particular types of transactions that should be notified. This should not only facilitate the achievement of full transparency of transactions by persons discharging managerial responsibilities and persons closely associated with them but also mitigate the risk of circumvention of the notification requirement by means of identifying particular types of notifiable transactions.
