(17) Taking into account the expanded scope of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 in terms of financial instruments covered, the fact that the ex post notification to the competent authority requirement applies to issuers who have requested or approved admission of their financial instruments to trading on a regulated market in a Member State or, in the case of instruments only traded on a multilateral trading facility (MTF) or on other types of organised trading facilities (OTFs), issuers who have approved trading of their financial instruments on an MTF or an OTF or have requested admission to trading of their financial instruments on an MTF in a Member State and the fact that such issuers may have their financial instruments admitted to trading or traded on trading venues in different Member States, it should be ensured that in all instances the single competent authority receiving the notification would be the one with the most interests in market supervision and to avoid the exercise of discretion by the issuer. This approach relies on using the notion of equity securities.
