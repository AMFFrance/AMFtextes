(23) Where the persons discharging managerial responsibilities present situations which are unforeseen, compelling and beyond their control, they should only be allowed to sell shares to obtain the necessary financial resources. Those situations could stem from a financial commitment that the person discharging managerial responsibilities has to fulfil, such as a legally enforceable demand, including a court order, and provided that the person discharging managerial responsibilities cannot reasonably meet this commitment without selling the concerned shares. It could also stem from a situation entered into by the person discharging managerial responsibilities before the closed period has started (for example, a tax liability) and requiring the payment of a sum to a third party that could not be fully or partly funded by the person discharging managerial responsibilities in ways other than selling issuer's shares.
