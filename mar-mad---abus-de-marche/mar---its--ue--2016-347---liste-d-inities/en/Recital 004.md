(4) To avoid multiple entries in respect of the same individuals in different sections of the insider lists, the issuers, emission allowance market participants, auction platforms, auctioneers and auction monitor, or the persons acting on their behalf or on their account, may decide to draw up and keep up to date a supplementary section of the insider list, referred to as the permanent insiders section, which is of a different nature to the rest of sections of the insider list, as it is not created upon the existence of a specific piece of inside information. In such a case, the permanent insiders section should only include those persons who, due to the nature of their function or position, have access at all times to all inside information within the issuer, the emission allowance market participant, the auction platform, the auctioneer or the auction monitor.
