(5) Competent authorities that have accepted a market practice should ensure it is monitored adequately with due care and attention. Therefore, persons performing the market practice should be required to keep sufficient records of all transactions and orders undertaken so as to enable competent authorities to fulfil their supervisory functions and to carry out the enforcement actions provided for in Regulation (EU) No 596/2014. It is also of paramount importance that their activity of performing the market practice can be distinguished from the other trading activities they conduct on their own account or on the account of clients. This may be achieved through the maintenance of separate accounts.
