(2) The template should contain the information on all the transactions conducted on a particular day by persons discharging managerial responsibilities or persons closely associated with them. To provide a comprehensive view to the public, the template should allow for the presentation of the transactions on an individual basis and also in an aggregated form. The aggregated information should indicate the volume of all the transactions of the same nature on the same financial instrument that have been carried out on the same trading day and on the same trading venue, or outside any trading venue, as a single figure representing the arithmetical sum of the volume of each transaction. It should also indicate the corresponding volume-weighted average price. When filling in the template transactions of different nature, such as purchases and sales, should never be aggregated nor should be netted between themselves.
