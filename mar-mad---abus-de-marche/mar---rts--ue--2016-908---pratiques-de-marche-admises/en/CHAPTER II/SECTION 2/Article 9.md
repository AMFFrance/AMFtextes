# Article 9 - Structural characteristics of the market


In taking into account, in accordance with point (g) of Article 13(2) of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, the participation of retail-investors in the relevant market, competent authorities shall assess at a minimum:

(a) the impact the market practice might have on retail investors' interests where the market practice concerns financial instruments traded on markets in which retail investors participate;

(b) whether the market practice increases the probability of retail investors to find counterparties in low-liquidity financial instruments, without increasing the risks borne by them.
