# Article 7 - Notification to competent authorities of significant net short positions in sovereign debt


1.   A natural or legal person who has a net short position relating to issued sovereign debt shall notify the relevant competent authority, in accordance with Article 9, where such a position reaches or falls below the relevant notification thresholds for the sovereign issuer concerned.

2.   The relevant notification thresholds shall consist of an initial amount and then additional incremental levels in relation to each sovereign issuer, as specified in the measures taken by the Commission in accordance with paragraph 3. ESMA shall publish on its website the notification thresholds for each Member State.

3.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 42 specifying the amounts and incremental levels referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article.

The Commission shall:

(a) ensure that the thresholds are not set at such a level as to require notification of positions which are of minimal value;

(b) take into account the total amount of outstanding issued sovereign debt for each sovereign issuer, and the average size of positions held by market participants relating to the sovereign debt of that sovereign issuer; and

(c) take into account the liquidity of each sovereign bond market.
