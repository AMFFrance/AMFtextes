(11) To be useful to regulators and markets, any transparency regime should provide complete and accurate information about a natural or legal person’s positions. In particular, information provided to the regulator or to the market should take into account both short and long positions so as to provide valuable information about the natural or legal person’s net short position in shares, sovereign debt and credit default swaps.
