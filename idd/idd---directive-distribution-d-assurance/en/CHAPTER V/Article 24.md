# Article 24 - Cross-selling


1.   When an insurance product is offered together with an ancillary product or service which is not insurance, as part of a package or the same agreement, the insurance distributor shall inform the customer whether it is possible to buy the different components separately and, if so, shall provide an adequate description of the different components of the agreement or package as well as separate evidence of the costs and charges of each component.

2.   In the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1, and where the risk or the insurance coverage resulting from such an agreement or package offered to a customer is different from that associated with the components taken separately, the insurance distributor shall provide an adequate description of the different components of the agreement or package and the way in which their interaction modifies the risk or the insurance coverage.

3.   Where an insurance product is ancillary to a good or a service which is not insurance, as part of a package or the same agreement, the insurance distributor shall offer the customer the possibility of buying the good or service separately. This paragraph shall not apply where an insurance product is ancillary to an investment service or activity as defined in point 2 of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU, a credit agreement as defined in point 3 of Article 4 of Directive 2014/17/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (15), or a payment account as defined in point 3 of Article 2 of Directive 2014/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (16).

4.   EIOPA may develop guidelines for the assessment and the supervision of cross-selling practices indicating situations in which cross-selling practices are not compliant with the obligations laid down in Article 17.

5.   This Article shall not prevent the distribution of insurance products which provide coverage for various types of risks (multi-risk insurance policies).

6.   In the cases referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3, Member States shall ensure that an insurance distributor specifies the demands and needs of the customer in relation to the insurance products that form part of the overall package or the same agreement.

7.   Member States may maintain or adopt additional stricter measures or intervene on a case-by-case basis to prohibit the sale of insurance together with an ancillary service or product which is not insurance, as part of a package or the same agreement, when they can demonstrate that such practices are detrimental to consumers.
