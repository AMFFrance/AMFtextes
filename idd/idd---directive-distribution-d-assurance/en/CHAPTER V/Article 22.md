# Article 22 - Information exemptions and flexibility clause


1.   The information referred to in Articles 18, 19 and 20 need not be provided when the insurance distributor carries out distribution activities in relation to the insurance of large risks.

Member States may provide that the information referred to in Articles 29 and 30 of this Directive need not be provided to a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU.

2.   Member States may maintain or adopt stricter provisions regarding the information requirements referred to in this Chapter provided that such provisions comply with Union law. Member States shall communicate to EIOPA and the Commission such national provisions.

Member States shall also take the necessary steps to ensure appropriate publication by their competent authorities of the information about whether and how the Member State has chosen to apply stricter provisions under this paragraph.

In particular, Member States may make the provision of advice referred to in the third subparagraph of Article 20(1) mandatory for the sales of any insurance product, or for certain types of insurance products. In such a case, such stricter national provisions shall be complied with by insurance distributors, including those operating under the freedom to provide services or the freedom of establishment, when concluding insurance contracts with customers having their habitual residence or establishment in that Member State.

3.   Member States may limit or prohibit the acceptance or receipt of fees, commissions or other monetary or non-monetary benefits paid or provided to insurance distributors by any third party, or a person acting on behalf of a third party, in relation to the distribution of insurance products.

4.   In order to establish a high level of transparency by all appropriate means, EIOPA shall ensure that the information it receives relating to national provisions is also communicated to customers, and to insurance and reinsurance distributors.

5.   Member States shall ensure that where the insurance distributor is responsible for the provision of mandatory occupational pension arrangements and an employee becomes a member of such an arrangement without having taken an individual decision to join it, the information referred to in this Chapter shall be provided to the employee promptly after their enrolment in the arrangement concerned.
