(25) Any permanent presence of an intermediary in the territory of another Member State that is equivalent to a branch should be treated in the same way as a branch, unless the intermediary lawfully sets up the presence in another legal form. Such could be the case, depending on further circumstances, even where that presence does not formally take the form of a branch but consists merely of an office managed by the own staff of the intermediary or by a person who is independent but has permanent authority to act for the intermediary in the same way as an agency would.
