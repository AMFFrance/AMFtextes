(59) Even though Member States are not prevented from laying down rules for administrative and criminal sanctions for the same breaches, Member States should not be required to lay down rules for administrative sanctions for the breaches of this Directive which are subject to national criminal law. In accordance with national law, Member States are not obliged to impose both administrative and criminal sanctions for the same offence, but they should be able to do so if their national law so permits. However, the maintenance of criminal sanctions instead of administrative sanctions for breaches of this Directive should not reduce or otherwise affect the ability of competent authorities to cooperate, access and exchange information in a timely way with competent authorities in other Member States for the purposes of this Directive, including after any referral of the relevant breaches to the competent judicial authorities for criminal prosecution.
