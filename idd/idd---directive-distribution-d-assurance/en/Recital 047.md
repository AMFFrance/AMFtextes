(47) It is essential for the customers to know whether they are dealing with an intermediary who gives advice on the basis of a fair and personal analysis. In order to assess whether the number of contracts and providers considered by the intermediary is sufficiently large to cater for a fair and personal analysis, appropriate consideration should be given, inter alia, to the needs of the customer, the number of providers in the market, the market share of those providers, the number of relevant insurance products available from each provider, and the features of those products. This Directive should not prevent Member States from imposing the requirement that an insurance intermediary who wishes to give advice on the basis of a fair and personal analysis on an insurance contract gives such advice on all the insurance contracts that such an insurance intermediary distributes.
