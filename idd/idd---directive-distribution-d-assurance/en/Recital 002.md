(2) Since the main objective and subject matter of this recast is to harmonise national provisions concerning insurance and reinsurance distribution, and since those activities are carried out across the Union, this new Directive should be based on Article 53(1) and Article 62 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The form of a directive is appropriate in order to enable the implementing provisions in the areas covered by this Directive, when necessary, to be adjusted to any existing specificities of the particular market and legal system in each Member State. This Directive should also aim at coordinating national rules concerning access to the activities of insurance and reinsurance distribution.
