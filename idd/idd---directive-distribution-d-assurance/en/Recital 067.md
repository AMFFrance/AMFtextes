(67) In order to attain the objectives set out in this Directive, the power to adopt acts in accordance with ArticleÂ 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of product oversight and governance requirements for all products, and, in relation to the distribution of insurance-based investment products, the management of conflicts of interest, the conditions under which inducements can be paid or received, and assessment of suitability and appropriateness. It is of particular importance that the Commission carries out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.
