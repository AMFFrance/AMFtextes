(24) Member States should establish a single information point which gives access to their registers for insurance, reinsurance and ancillary insurance intermediaries. That single information point should also provide a hyperlink to each relevant competent authority in each Member State. In order to enhance transparency and facilitate cross-border trade, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) established by Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) should establish, publish and keep up-to-date a single electronic database containing a record of each insurance, reinsurance and ancillary insurance intermediary which has notified an intention to exercise its freedom of establishment or to provide services. Member States should provide relevant information to EIOPA promptly to enable it to do this. The database should provide a hyperlink to each relevant competent authority in each Member State. Each competent authority of each Member State should provide on its website a hyperlink to the database.
