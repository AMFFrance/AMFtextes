(12) This Directive should apply to persons whose activity consists of the provision of information on one or more contracts of insurance in response to criteria selected by the customer, whether via a website or other media, or the provision of a ranking of insurance products or a discount on the price of an insurance contract when the customer is able to directly or indirectly conclude an insurance contract at the end of the process. This Directive should not apply to websites managed by public authorities or consumersâ€™ associations which do not aim to conclude any contract but merely compare insurance products available on the market.
