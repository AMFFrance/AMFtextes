(32) Member States should not need to consider as relevant persons those managers or employees not directly involved in the distribution of insurance or reinsurance products. Concerning insurance and reinsurance intermediaries and undertakings, all employees directly involved in the distribution activity should be expected to possess an appropriate level of knowledge and competence, with certain exceptions, such as for those who are devoted solely to administrative tasks. Concerning ancillary insurance intermediaries, at least the persons responsible for ancillary insurance distribution should be considered among the relevant employees who are expected to possess an appropriate level of knowledge and competence. Where the insurance and reinsurance distributor is a legal person, the persons within the management structure in charge of executing policies and procedures relating to the activity of distribution of insurance or reinsurance products should also abide by appropriate knowledge and competence requirements. To that end, the person who is responsible for the activity of insurance or reinsurance distribution within the insurance, reinsurance and ancillary insurance intermediary should always abide by the knowledge and competence requirements.
