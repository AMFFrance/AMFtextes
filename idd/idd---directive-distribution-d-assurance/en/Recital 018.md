(18) Insurance, reinsurance and ancillary insurance intermediaries who are natural persons should be registered with the competent authority of the Member State where they have their residence. With regard to those persons commuting on a daily basis between the Member State of their private residence and the Member State from which they carry out their distribution activity, i.e. their professional residence, the Member State of registration should be that of the professional residence. Those insurance, reinsurance and ancillary insurance intermediaries who are legal persons should be registered with the competent authority of the Member State where they have their registered office or, if under their national law they have no registered office, their head office. Member States should be able to allow other bodies to cooperate with competent authorities in the registration and regulation of insurance intermediaries. Insurance, reinsurance and ancillary insurance intermediaries should be registered provided that they meet strict professional requirements in relation to their ability, good repute, professional indemnity cover and financial capacity. Intermediaries already registered in Member States should not be required to register again under this Directive.
