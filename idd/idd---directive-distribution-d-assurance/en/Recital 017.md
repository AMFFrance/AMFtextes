(17) This Directive should take into account the differences in the types of distribution channel. It should, for example, take into account the characteristics of insurance intermediaries who are under a contractual obligation to conduct insurance distribution business exclusively with one or more insurance undertakings (tied insurance intermediaries) which exist in certain Member Statesâ€™ markets, and should establish appropriate and proportionate conditions applicable to the different types of distribution. In particular, Member States should be able to stipulate that the insurance or reinsurance distributor which is responsible for the activity of an insurance, reinsurance or ancillary insurance intermediary is to ensure that such intermediary meets the conditions for registration and is to register that intermediary.
