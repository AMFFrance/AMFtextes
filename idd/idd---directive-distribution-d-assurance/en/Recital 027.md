(27) In order to deal with situations where an insurance or ancillary insurance intermediary is established in a Member State with the sole purpose of avoiding compliance with the rules of another Member State which is the place where it entirely or principally carries out its activity, the possibility for the host Member State to take precautionary measures may be an appropriate solution where its activity seriously endangers the proper functioning of the insurance and reinsurance market of the host Member State, and should not be prevented by this Directive. However, those measures should not be an obstacle to the freedom to provide services and the freedom of establishment, nor an access barrier to cross-border activity.
