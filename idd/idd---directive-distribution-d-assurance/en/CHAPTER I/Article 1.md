2.   This Directive applies to any natural or legal person who is established in a Member State or who wishes to be established there in order to take up and pursue the distribution of insurance and reinsurance products.

3.   This Directive shall not apply to ancillary insurance intermediaries carrying out insurance distribution activities where all the following conditions are met:

(a) the insurance is complementary to the good or service supplied by a provider, where such insurance covers: (i) the risk of breakdown, loss of, or damage to, the good or the non-use of the service supplied by that provider; or (ii) damage to, or loss of, baggage and other risks linked to travel booked with that provider;

(b) the amount of the premium paid for the insurance product does not exceed EUR 600 calculated on a pro rata annual basis;

4.   Member States shall ensure that, when carrying out a distribution activity through an ancillary insurance intermediary who is exempted from the application of this Directive pursuant to paragraph 3, the insurance undertaking or insurance intermediary ensures that:

(a) information is made available to the customer, prior to the conclusion of the contract, about its identity and address and about the procedures referred to in Article 14 allowing customers and other interested parties to lodge complaints;

(b) appropriate and proportionate arrangements are in place to comply with Articles 17 and 24 and to consider the demands and needs of the customer before the proposal of the contract;

(c) the insurance product information document referred to in Article 20(5) is provided to the customer prior to the conclusion of the contract.

5.   Member States shall ensure that competent authorities monitor the market, including the market for ancillary insurance products which are marketed, distributed or sold in, or from, their Member State. EIOPA may facilitate and coordinate such monitoring.

6.   This Directive shall not apply to insurance and reinsurance distribution activities in relation to risks and commitments located outside the Union.

This Directive shall not affect a Member State’s law in respect of insurance and reinsurance distribution activities pursued by insurance and reinsurance undertakings or intermediaries established in a third country and operating on its territory under the principle of freedom to provide services, provided that equal treatment is guaranteed to all persons carrying out or authorised to carry out insurance and reinsurance distribution activities on that market.

This Directive shall not regulate insurance or reinsurance distribution activities carried out in third countries.

Member States shall inform the Commission of any general difficulties which their insurance or reinsurance distributors encounter in establishing themselves or carrying out insurance or reinsurance distribution activities in any third country.
