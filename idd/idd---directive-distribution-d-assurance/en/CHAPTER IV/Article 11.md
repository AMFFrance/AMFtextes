4.   Member States shall establish a single point of contact responsible for providing information on ‘general good’ rules in their respective Member State. Such a point of contact should be an appropriate competent authority.

5.   EIOPA shall examine in a report, and inform the Commission about, the ‘general good’ rules published by Member States as referred to in this Article in the context of the proper functioning of this Directive and of the internal market before 23 February 2019.
