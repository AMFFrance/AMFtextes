(42) Insurance intermediaries and insurance undertakings are subject to uniform requirements when distributing insurance-based investment products, as laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6). In addition to the information required to be provided in the form of the key information document, distributors of insurance-based investment products should provide additional information detailing any cost of distribution that is not already included in the costs specified in the key information document, so as to enable the customer to understand the cumulative effect that those aggregate costs have on the return of the investment. This Directive should therefore lay down rules on provision of information on costs of the distribution service connected to the insurance-based investment products in question.
