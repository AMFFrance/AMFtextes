(48) Prior to the conclusion of a contract, including in the case of non-advised sales, the customer should be given the relevant information about the insurance product to allow the customer to make an informed decision. An insurance product information document should provide standardised information about non-life insurance products. It should be drawn up by the relevant insurance undertaking or, in the Member States concerned, by the insurance intermediary that manufactures the insurance product. The insurance intermediary should explain to the customer the key features of the insurance products it sells, and its staff should therefore be given appropriate resources and time to do so.
