# Article 41 - Review and evaluation


1.   By 23 February 2021, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the application of Article 1. Such report shall include an assessment, on the basis of information received from the Member States and EIOPA pursuant to Article 1(5), of whether the scope of this Directive, including the exception in Article 1(3), remains appropriate with regard to the level of consumer protection, the proportionality of treatment between different insurance distributors and the administrative burden imposed on competent authorities and insurance distribution channels.

2.   By 23 February 2021, the Commission shall review this Directive. The review shall include a general survey of the practical application of rules under this Directive taking due account of developments in the retail investment products markets as well as experiences acquired in the practical application of this Directive and of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 and Directive 2014/65/EU. The review shall include an evaluation of whether the specific conduct of business rules for the distribution of insurance-based investment products set out in Chapter VI of this Directive deliver appropriate and proportionate results, taking into account the need to ensure a sufficient level of consumer protection consistent with the investor protection standards applicable under Directive 2014/65/EU and the specific characteristics of insurance-based investment products and the specific nature of their distribution channels. The review shall also reflect upon a possible application of the provisions of this Directive to products falling under the scope of Directive 2003/41/EC. Such review shall also include a specific analysis of the impact of Article 19 of this Directive, taking into account the situation of competition in the market of insurance distribution for contracts other than contracts in any of the classes specified in Annex II to Directive 2009/138/EC and the impact of the obligations referred to in Article 19 of this Directive on insurance intermediaries which are small and medium sized enterprises.

3.   After consulting the Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities, the Commission shall submit a first report to the European Parliament and the Council.

4.   By 23 February 2020, and at least every two years thereafter, EIOPA shall prepare a further report on the application of this Directive. EIOPA shall consult the European Securities and Markets Authority before making public its report.

5.   In a third report to be prepared by 23 February 2018, EIOPA shall undertake an evaluation of the structure of insurance intermediaries’ markets.

6.   The report to be prepared by EIOPA by 23 February 2020 referred to in paragraph 4 shall examine whether the competent authorities referred to in Article 12(1) are sufficiently empowered and have adequate resources to carry out their tasks.

7.   The report referred to in paragraph 4 shall examine at least the following issues:

(a) any changes in the insurance intermediaries’ market structure;

(b) any changes in the patterns of cross-border activity;

(c) the improvement of quality of advice and selling methods and the impact of this Directive on insurance intermediaries which are small and medium-sized enterprises.

8.   The report referred to in paragraph 4 shall also include an evaluation by EIOPA of the impact of this Directive.
