(52) This Directive should specify the minimum obligations of insurance distributors in providing information to customers. A Member State should be able to maintain or adopt more stringent provisions in the area of information provision which may be imposed on insurance distributors independently of the provisions of their home Member State where such distributors are pursuing insurance distribution activities on that Member State’s territory, provided that those more stringent provisions comply with Union law, including Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7). A Member State which proposes to apply and applies provisions regulating insurance distributors and the sale of insurance products in addition to those set out in this Directive should ensure that the administrative burden stemming from those provisions is proportionate with regard to consumer protection and remains limited.
