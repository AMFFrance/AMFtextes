(15) This Directive should not apply to persons practising insurance distribution as an ancillary activity where the premium does not exceed a certain amount and the risks covered are limited. Such insurance can be complementary to a good or to a service, including in relation to the risk of non-use of a service expected to be used at a certain point in time, such as a train journey, a gym subscription or a seasonal theatre pass, and other risks linked to travel such as travel cancellation or loss of baggage. However, in order to ensure that an adequate degree of consumer protection is always attached to the activity of insurance distribution, an insurance undertaking or insurance intermediary, carrying out the distribution activity through an ancillary insurance intermediary exempted from the requirements set out in this Directive, should ensure the fulfilment of certain basic requirements, such as the communication of its identity and of the way in which a complaint can be lodged, and that the demands and needs of the customer are considered.
