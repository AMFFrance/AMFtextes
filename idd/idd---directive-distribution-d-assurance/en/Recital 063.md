(63) In order to ensure that decisions on breaches by competent authorities have a dissuasive effect on the public at large and to inform market participants about behaviour that is considered detrimental to customers, those decisions should be published, provided that the time period for lodging an appeal has passed and no appeal was lodged, unless such disclosure jeopardises the stability of financial markets or an ongoing investigation. Where national law provides for the publication of the sanction or other measure which is subject to an appeal, such information, as well as the outcome of the appeal, should also be published without undue delay. In any event, if publication of the sanction or other measure would cause disproportionate damage to the parties involved, the competent authority should be able to decide not to publish the sanction or other measure or to publish it anonymously.
