1.   Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities establish effective mechanisms to enable and encourage the reporting to them of possible or actual breaches of national provisions implementing this Directive.

2.   The mechanisms referred to in paragraph 1 shall include at least:

(a) specific procedures for the receipt of reports and their follow-up;

(b) appropriate protection, at least against retaliation, discrimination or other types of unfair treatment, for employees of insurance or reinsurance distributors and, where possible, for other persons, who report infringements committed within those entities; and

(c) protection of the identity of both the person who reports the breach and the natural person who is allegedly responsible for the breach, at all stages of the procedure unless such disclosure is required by national law in the context of further investigation or subsequent administrative or judicial proceedings.
