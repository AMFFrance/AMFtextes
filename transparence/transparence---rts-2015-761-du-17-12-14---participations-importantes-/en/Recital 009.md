(9) The provisions in this Regulation are closely linked, since they deal with the requirements relating to notification of major holdings in listed companies. To ensure coherence between those provisions, which should enter into force at the same time, and to facilitate a comprehensive view and compact access to them by persons subject to those obligations, including investors that are non-Union residents, it is desirable to include certain of the regulatory technical standards required by Directive 2004/109/EC in a single Regulation.
