(5) Harmonisation of the format used to exchange information between the EEAP and the OAMs is necessary in order to ensure the effective functioning of the EEAP. Accordingly, the identification of the appropriate format for exchange of information should take into account the security exchange and validation attributes of the most common standard formats used on the market. As the EEAP should not assume the functions of OAMs in respect of storage of regulated information, the format for exchange of regulated information should determine the metadata on regulated information to be enabled by an OAM to ensure a focussed search and fast access to regulated information by end users.
