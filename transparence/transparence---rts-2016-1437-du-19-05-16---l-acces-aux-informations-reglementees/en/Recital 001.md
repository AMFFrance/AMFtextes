(1) In order to ensure fast access to regulated information on a non-discriminatory basis and make that information available to end users, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has an obligation to develop and operate a European Electronic Access Point (EEAP). The EEAP should be conceived as a web portal accessible through ESMA's website and, given its centralising role, should not assume the functions of official appointed mechanisms (OAMs) in respect of storage of regulated information. The EEAP should provide access to regulated information stored by all OAMs, avoid the duplication of data storage and minimise the risks to security of data exchange.
