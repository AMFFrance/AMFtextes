(3) The proper functioning of the EEAP and its connection with OAMs depend on the security, effectiveness, efficiency and adaptability of the supporting communication technologies. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure should be used by the EEAP and OAMs to connect with each other. However, given the continuous developments in communication technologies and the need to ensure the integrity and security of the exchange of metadata on regulated information, ESMA and the OAMs should cooperate in identifying and implementing alternative communication technologies in the future. Furthermore, where ESMA considers, according to objective technical criteria, that cooperation required for that purpose is ineffective, ESMA should be able to indicate what alternative communication technologies are to be used by the EEAP and OAMs.
