(4) The repurchases or redemptions which should be relevant for determining whether an AIFM is managing AIFs of the open-ended or closed-ended type should only be the ones made out of the assets of the AIF. Therefore, whether an AIF's shares or units can be negotiated on the secondary market and are not repurchased or redeemed by the AIF should not be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether or not the AIF is of the open-ended type.
