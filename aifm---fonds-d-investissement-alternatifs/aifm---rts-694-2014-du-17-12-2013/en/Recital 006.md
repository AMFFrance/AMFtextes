(6) Any change in the redemption policy of an AIF implying that the AIF may be considered no longer as being an AIF of the open-ended type or an AIF of the closed-ended type, should lead the AIFM to cease to apply the rules relating to the old redemption policy of the AIF it manages and to apply the rules relating to the new redemption policy of such AIF.
