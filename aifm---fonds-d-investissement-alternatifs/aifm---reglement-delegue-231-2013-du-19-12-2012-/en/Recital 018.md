(18) The requirement that netting arrangements refer to the same underlying asset should be interpreted strictly so that assets which the AIFM considers as equivalent or highly correlated, such as different share classes or bonds issued by the same issuer, should not be considered as identical for the purposes of netting arrangements. The definition of netting arrangements aims to ensure that only those trades which offset the risks linked to other trades, leaving no material residual risk, are taken into account. Combinations of trades which aim to generate a return, however small, by reducing some risks while keeping others should not be considered as netting arrangements, as with arbitrage investment strategies which aim to generate a return by taking advantage of pricing discrepancies between derivative instruments with the same underlying but different maturities.
