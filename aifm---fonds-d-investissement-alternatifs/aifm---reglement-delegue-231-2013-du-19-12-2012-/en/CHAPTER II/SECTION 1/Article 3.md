# Article 3 - Ongoing monitoring of assets under management


AIFMs shall establish, implement and apply procedures to monitor on an ongoing basis the total value of assets under management. Monitoring shall reflect an up-to-date overview of the assets under management and shall include the observation of subscription and redemption activity or, where applicable, capital draw downs, capital distributions and the value of the assets invested in for each AIF.

The proximity of the total value of assets under management to the threshold set in Article 3(2) of Directive 2011/61/EU and the anticipated subscription and redemption activity shall be taken into account in order to assess the need for more frequent calculations of the total value of assets under management.
