(71) Disclosure to investors is of paramount importance to protect those investors, so AIFMs should implement appropriate policies and procedures to ensure that the redemption terms applicable to a particular AIF are disclosed in sufficient detail and with sufficient prominence to investors before they invest and in the event of material changes. That could include disclosure of notice periods in relation to redemptions, details of lock-up periods, an indication of circumstances in which normal redemption mechanisms might not apply or may be suspended, and details of any measures that may be considered by the governing body, such as gates, side pocketing, as they have an impact on the specific redemption rights of investors in the particular AIF.
