(114) To be ascertained as such, it is important that the loss is definitive, and there is no prospect of recovering the financial asset. Thus, situations where a financial instrument is only temporarily unavailable or frozen should not count as losses within the meaning of Article 21(12) of Directive 2011/61/EU. In contrast, three types of situations can be identified where the loss should be deemed to be definitive: where the financial instrument no longer exists or never did exist; where the financial instrument exists but the AIF has definitively lost its right of ownership over it; and where the AIF has the ownership right but can no longer transfer title of or create limited property rights in the financial instrument on a permanent basis.
