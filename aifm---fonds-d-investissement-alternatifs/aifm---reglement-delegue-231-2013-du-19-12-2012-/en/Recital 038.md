(38) As a matter of principle, the adequacy of coverage through additional own funds or professional indemnity insurance should be reviewed at least once a year. However, the AIFM should have procedures in place that ensure ongoing monitoring of the total value of AIF portfolios managed and ongoing adjustments to the amount of coverage of professional liability risks should there be significant mismatches identified. Furthermore, the competent authority of the home Member State of an AIFM may lower or increase the minimum requirement for additional own funds, after taking into account the risk profile of the AIFM, its loss history and the adequacy of its additional own funds or professional indemnity insurance.
