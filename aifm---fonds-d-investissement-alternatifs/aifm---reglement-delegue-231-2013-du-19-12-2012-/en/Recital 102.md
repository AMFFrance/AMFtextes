(102) In order to avoid circumvention of the requirements of Directive 2011/61/EU, the depositary should apply the safe-keeping duties to the underlying assets of financial structures and, as the case may be, or legal structures controlled directly or indirectly by the AIF or by the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF. That look-through provision should not apply to funds of funds or master-feeder structures provided they have a depositary which safe-keeps the fundâ€™s assets appropriately.
