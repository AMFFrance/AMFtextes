(32) Pursuant to Directive 2011/61/EU, an AIFM has to ensure that the potential professional liability risks resulting from its activities are appropriately covered either by way of additional own funds or by way of professional indemnity insurance. Uniform application of this provision requires a common understanding of the potential professional liability risks to be covered. The general specification of the risks arising from an AIFM’s professional negligence should determine the features of the relevant risk events and identify the scope of potential professional liability, including damage or loss caused by persons who are directly performing activities for which the AIFM has legal responsibility, such as the AIFM’s directors, officers or staff, and persons performing activities under a delegation arrangement with the AIFM. In line with the provisions of Directive 2011/61/EU, the liability of the AIFM should not be affected by delegation or sub-delegation and the AIFM should provide adequate coverage for professional risks related to such third parties for whom it is legally liable.
