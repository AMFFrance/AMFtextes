(40) In line with the approach applied to UCITS managers, AIFMs should ensure a high standard of diligence in the selection and monitoring of investments. They should have appropriate professional expertise and knowledge of the assets in which AIFs are invested. In order to ensure that investment decisions are carried out in compliance with the investment strategy and, where applicable, risk limits of the AIFs managed, AIFMs should establish and implement written policies and procedures on due diligence. These policies and procedures should be reviewed and updated on a regular basis. When AIFMs invest in specific types of assets for a long duration, less liquid assets such as real estate or partnership interests, due diligence requirements should apply also to the negotiation phase. The activities performed by the AIFM before closing an agreement should be well documented in order to demonstrate that they are consistent with the economic and financial plan and therefore with the duration of the AIF. AIFMs should maintain minutes of the relevant meetings, the preparatory documentation and the economic and financial analysis conducted for assessing the feasibility of the project and the contractual commitment.
