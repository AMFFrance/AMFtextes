(1) Directive 2011/61/EU empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts specifying, in particular, the rules relating to calculation of the threshold, leverage, operating conditions for Alternative Investment Fund Managers (hereinafter ‘AIFMs’), including risk and liquidity management, valuation and delegation, requirements detailing the functions and duties of depositaries of Alternative Investment Funds (hereinafter ‘AIFs’), rules on transparency and specific requirements relating to third countries. It is important that all these supplementing rules begin to apply at the same time as Directive 2011/61/EU so that the new requirements imposed on AIFMs can be effectively put into operation. The provisions in this Regulation are closely interrelated, since they deal with the authorisation, ongoing operation and transparency of AIFMs which manage and, as the case may be, or market AIFs in the Union, which are inextricably linked aspects inherent to the taking up and pursuit of the asset management business. To ensure coherence between those provisions, which should enter into force at the same time, and to facilitate a comprehensive view and compact access to them by persons subject to those obligations, including investors that are non-Union residents, it is desirable to include all delegated acts required by Directive 2011/61/EU in a single Regulation.
