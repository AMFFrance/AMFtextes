(35) To ensure that additional own funds and professional liability insurance appropriately cover potential professional liability risks, quantitative minimum benchmarks should be established for determining the proper level of coverage. Such quantitative benchmarks should be determined by the AIFM as a specific percentage of the value of portfolios of AIFs managed, calculated as the sum of the absolute value of all assets of all AIFs managed, irrespective of whether they are acquired through use of leverage or with investorsâ€™ money. In this context, derivative instruments should be valued at their market price as they could be replaced at that price. As coverage through professional indemnity insurance is by nature more uncertain than coverage provided through additional own funds, different percentages should apply to the two different instruments used for covering professional liability risk.
