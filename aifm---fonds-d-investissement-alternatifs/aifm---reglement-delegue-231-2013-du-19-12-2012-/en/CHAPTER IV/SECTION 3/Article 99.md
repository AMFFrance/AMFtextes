# Article 99 - Segregation obligation


1.   Where safekeeping functions have been delegated wholly or partly to a third party, a depositary shall ensure that the third party, to whom safe-keeping functions are delegated pursuant to Article 21(11) of Directive 2011/61/EU, acts in accordance with the segregation obligation laid down in point (iii) of Article 21(11)(d) of Directive 2011/61/EU by verifying that the third party:

(a) keeps such records and accounts as are necessary to enable it at any time and without delay to distinguish assets of the depositary’s AIF clients from its own assets, assets of its other clients, assets held by the depositary for its own account and assets held for clients of the depositary which are not AIFs;

(b) maintains records and accounts in a way that ensures their accuracy, and in particular their correspondence to the assets safe-kept for the depositary’s clients;

(c) conducts, on a regular basis, reconciliations between its internal accounts and records and those of the third party to whom it has delegated safe-keeping functions in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 21(11) of Directive 2011/61/EU;

(d) introduces adequate organisational arrangements to minimise the risk of loss or diminution of financial instruments or of rights in connection with those financial instruments as a result of misuse of the financial instruments, fraud, poor administration, inadequate record-keeping or negligence;

(e) Where the third party is an entity referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 18(1) of Directive 2006/73/EC which is subject to effective prudential regulation and supervision that has the same effect as Union law and is effectively enforced, the depositary shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the AIF’s cash is held in an account or accounts in accordance with Article 21(7) of Directive 2011/61/EU.

2.   Where a depositary has delegated its custody functions to a third party in accordance with Article 21(11) of Directive 2011/61/EU, the monitoring of the third party’s compliance with its segregation obligations shall ensure that the financial instruments belonging to its clients are protected from any insolvency of that third party. If, according to the applicable law, including in particular the law relating to property or insolvency, the requirements laid down in paragraph 1 are not sufficient to achieve that objective, the depositary shall assess what additional arrangements are to be made in order to minimise the risk of loss and maintain an adequate standard of protection.

3.   Paragraphs 1, and 2 shall apply mutatis mutandis when the third party, to whom safe-keeping functions are delegated in accordance with Article 21(11) of Directive 2011/61/EU, has decided to delegate all or part of its safe-keeping functions to another third party pursuant to the third subparagraph of Article 21(11) of Directive 2011/61/EU.
