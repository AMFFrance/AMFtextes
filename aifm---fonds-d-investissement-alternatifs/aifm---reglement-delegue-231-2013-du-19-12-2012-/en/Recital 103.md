(103) The depositary should at all times have a comprehensive overview of all assets that are not financial instruments to be held in custody. Those assets would be subject to the obligation to verify the ownership and maintain a record under Directive 2011/61/EU. Examples of such assets are physical assets which do not qualify as financial instruments under Directive 2011/61/EU or could not be physically delivered to the depositary, financial contracts such as derivatives, cash deposits or investments in privately held companies and interests in partnerships.
