(74) The requirement to establish a permanent and effective compliance function should always be fulfilled by the AIFM, irrespective of the size and complexity of its business. However, details of the technical and personnel organisation of the compliance function should be calibrated to the nature, scale and complexity of the AIFMâ€™s business and the nature and range of its services and activities. The AIFM should not have to establish an independent compliance unit if such a requirement would be disproportionate in view of the size of the AIFM or the nature, scale and complexity of its business.
