(89) To maintain a high standard of investor protection possible conflicts of interest have to be taken into account for any delegation. Several criteria should set benchmarks for identifying situations which would result in a material conflict of interest. Those criteria should be understood as non-exhaustive and meaning that non-material conflicts of interest are also relevant for the purposes of Directive 2011/61/EU. Thus, the carrying out of compliance or audit functions should be deemed as conflicting with portfolio management tasks, whereas market making or underwriting should be understood as conflicting with portfolio or risk management. That obligation is without prejudice to the obligation of the delegate to separate functionally and hierarchically the tasks of portfolio and risk management from each other according to the provisions of Article 15 of Directive 2011/61/EU.
