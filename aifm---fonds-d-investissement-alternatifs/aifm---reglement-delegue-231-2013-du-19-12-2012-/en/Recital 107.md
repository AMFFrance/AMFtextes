(107) The depositary should check the consistency between the number of units or shares issued and the subscription proceeds received. Moreover, to ensure that payments made by investors upon subscription have been received, the depositary should further ensure that another reconciliation is conducted between the subscription orders and the subscription proceeds. The same reconciliation should be performed with regard to redemption orders. The depositary should also verify that the number of units or shares in the AIF’s accounts matches the number of outstanding units or shares in the AIF’s register. The depositary should adapt its procedures accordingly, taking into account the frequency of subscriptions and redemptions.
