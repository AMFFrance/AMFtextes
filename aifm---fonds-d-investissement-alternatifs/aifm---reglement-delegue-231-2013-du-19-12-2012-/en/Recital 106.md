(106) In order to ensure that the depositary is able to conduct its duties, it is necessary to clarify the tasks provided for in Article 21(9) of Directive 2011/61/EU, and in particular the second layer controls to be undertaken by the depositary. Such tasks should not prevent the depositary from conducting ex-ante verifications where it deems appropriate, and in agreement with the AIFM. In order to ensure that it is able to conduct its duties, the depositary should establish its own escalation procedure to address situations where irregularities have been detected. That procedure should ensure the notification of competent authorities of any material breaches. The oversight responsibilities of the depositary towards third parties specified by this Regulation are without prejudice to the responsibilities incumbent on the AIFM under Directive 2011/61/EU.
