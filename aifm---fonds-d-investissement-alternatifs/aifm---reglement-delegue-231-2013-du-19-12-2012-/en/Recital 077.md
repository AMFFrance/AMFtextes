(77) Where a model is used for valuing assets, the valuation procedures and policies should indicate the main features of the model. Before it is used, that model should be subject to a validation process conducted by an internal or external individual who was not involved in the process of building the model. A person should be considered qualified to conduct a validation process in respect of the model used to value assets if he is in possession of adequate competence and experience in the valuation of assets using such models; such person could be an auditor.
