(16) When calculating exposure according to the commitment method, derivatives which fulfil the criteria set out in this Regulation do not provide any incremental exposure. Thus, if the AIF invests in index future contracts and holds a cash position equal to the total underlying market value of future contracts, this would be equivalent to directly investing in index shares and therefore the index future contract should not be taken into account for the purpose of calculating the exposure of the AIF.
