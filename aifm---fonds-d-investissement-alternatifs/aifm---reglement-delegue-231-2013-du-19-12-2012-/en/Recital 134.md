(134) To allow EU AIFMs to manage and market non-EU AIFs and non-EU AIFMs to manage and market AIFs in the Union, Directive 2011/61/EU requires appropriate cooperation arrangements to be put in place with the relevant supervisory authorities of the third country where the non-EU AIF and, as the case may be, or the non-EU AIFM is established. Such cooperation arrangements should ensure at least an efficient exchange of information that allows Union competent authorities to carry out their duties in accordance with Directive 2011/61/EU.
