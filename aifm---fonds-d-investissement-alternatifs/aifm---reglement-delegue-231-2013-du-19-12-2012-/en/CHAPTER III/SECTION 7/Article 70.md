# Article 70 - Periodic review of valuation policies and procedures


1.   Valuation policies shall provide for a periodic review of the policies and procedures, including of the valuation methodologies. The review shall be carried out at least annually and before the AIF engages with a new investment strategy or a new type of asset that is not covered by the actual valuation policy.

2.   The valuation policies and procedures shall outline how a change to the valuation policy, including a methodology, may be effected and in what circumstances this would be appropriate. Recommendations for changes to the policies and procedures shall be made to the senior management, which shall review and approve any changes.

3.   The risk management function referred to in Article 38 shall review and, if needed, provide appropriate support concerning the policies and procedures adopted for the valuation of assets.
