# Article 75 - General principles


When delegating the task of carrying out one or more functions on their behalf, AIFMs shall comply, in particular, with the following general principles:

(a) the delegation structure does not allow for the circumvention of the AIFM’s responsibilities or liability;

(b) the obligations of the AIFM towards the AIF and its investors are not altered as a result of the delegation;

(c) the conditions with which the AIFM must comply in order to be authorised and carry out activities in accordance with Directive 2011/61/EU are not undermined;

(d) the delegation arrangement takes the form of a written agreement concluded between the AIFM and the delegate;

(e) the AIFM ensures that the delegate carries out the delegated functions effectively and in compliance with applicable law and regulatory requirements and must establish methods and procedures for reviewing on an ongoing basis the services provided by the delegate. The AIFM shall take appropriate action if it appears that the delegate cannot carry out the functions effectively or in compliance with applicable laws and regulatory requirements;

(f) the AIFM supervises effectively the delegated functions and manages the risks associated with the delegation. For this purpose the AIFM shall have at all times the necessary expertise and resources to supervise the delegated functions. The AIFM shall set out in the agreement its right of information, inspection, admittance and access, and its instruction and monitoring rights against the delegate. The AIFM shall also ensure that the delegate properly supervises the performance of the delegated functions, and adequately manages the risks associated with the delegation;

(g) the AIFM ensures that the continuity and quality of the delegated functions or of the delegated task of carrying out functions are maintained also in the event of termination of the delegation either by transferring the delegated functions or the delegated task of carrying out functions to another third party or by performing them itself;

(h) the respective rights and obligations of the AIFM and the delegate are clearly allocated and set out in the agreement. In particular, the AIFM shall contractually ensure its instruction and termination rights, its rights of information, and its right to inspections and access to books and premises. The agreement shall make sure that sub-delegation can take place only with the consent of the AIFM;

(i) where it concerns portfolio management, the delegation is in accordance with the investment policy of the AIF. The delegate shall be instructed by the AIFM how to implement the investment policy and the AIFM shall monitor whether the delegate complies with it on an ongoing basis;

(j) the AIFM ensures that the delegate discloses to the AIFM any development that may have a material impact on the delegate’s ability to carry out the delegated functions effectively and in compliance with applicable laws and regulatory requirements;

(k) the AIFM ensures that the delegate protects any confidential information relating to the AIFM, the AIF affected by the delegation and the investors in that AIF;

(l) the AIFM ensures that the delegate establishes, implements and maintains a contingency plan for disaster recovery and periodic testing of backup facilities while taking into account the types of delegated functions.
