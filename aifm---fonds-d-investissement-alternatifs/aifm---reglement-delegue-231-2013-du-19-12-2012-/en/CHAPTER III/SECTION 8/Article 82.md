# Article 82 - Letter-box entity and AIFM no longer considered to be managing an AIF


1.   An AIFM shall be deemed a letter-box entity and shall no longer be considered to be the manager of the AIF at least in any of the following situations:

(a) the AIFM no longer retains the necessary expertise and resources to supervise the delegated tasks effectively and manage the risks associated with the delegation;

(b) the AIFM no longer has the power to take decisions in key areas which fall under the responsibility of the senior management or no longer has the power to perform senior management functions in particular in relation to the implementation of the general investment policy and investment strategies;

(c) the AIFM loses its contractual rights to inquire, inspect, have access or give instructions to its delegates or the exercise of such rights becomes impossible in practice;

(d) the AIFM delegates the performance of investment management functions to an extent that exceeds by a substantial margin the investment management functions performed by the AIFM itself. When assessing the extent of delegation, competent authorities shall assess the entire delegation structure taking into account not only the assets managed under delegation but also the following qualitative criteria: (i) the types of assets the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF is invested in, and the importance of the assets managed under delegation for the risk and return profile of the AIF; (ii) the importance of the assets under delegation for the achievement of the investment goals of the AIF; (iii) the geographical and sectoral spread of the AIF’s investments; (iv) the risk profile of the AIF; (v) the type of investment strategies pursued by the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF; (vi) the types of tasks delegated in relation to those retained; and (vii) the configuration of delegates and their sub-delegates, their geographical sphere of operation and their corporate structure, including whether the delegation is conferred on an entity belonging to the same corporate group as the AIFM.

2.   The Commission shall monitor, in the light of market developments, the application of this Article. The Commission shall review the situation after two years and shall, if necessary, take appropriate measures to further specify the conditions under which the AIFM shall be deemed to have delegated its functions to the extent that it becomes a letter box entity and can no longer be considered to be manager of the AIF.

3.   ESMA may issue guidelines to ensure a consistent assessment of delegation structures across the Union.
