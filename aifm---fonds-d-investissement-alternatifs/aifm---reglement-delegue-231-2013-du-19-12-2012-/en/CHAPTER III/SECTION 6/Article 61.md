# Article 61 - Permanent compliance function


1.   AIFMs shall establish, implement and maintain adequate policies and procedures designed to detect any risk of failure by the AIFM to comply with its obligations under Directive 2011/61/EU, and the associated risks, and put in place adequate measures and procedures designed to minimise such risk and to enable the competent authorities to exercise their powers effectively under that Directive.

The AIFM shall take into account the nature, scale and complexity of its business, and the nature and range of services and activities undertaken in the course of that business.

2.   An AIFM shall establish and maintain a permanent and effective compliance function which operates independently and has the following responsibilities:

(a) monitoring and, on a regular basis, evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of the measures, policies and procedures put in place in accordance with paragraph 1 and the actions taken to address any deficiencies in the AIFM’s compliance with its obligations;

(b) advising the relevant persons responsible for carrying out services and activities and assisting them in complying with the AIFM’s obligations under Directive 2011/61/EU.

3.   In order to enable the compliance function referred to in paragraph 2 to perform its responsibilities properly and independently, the AIFM shall ensure that:

(a) the compliance function has the necessary authority, resources, expertise and access to all relevant information;

(b) a compliance officer is appointed and is responsible for the compliance function and for reporting on a frequent basis, and at least annually, to the senior management on matters of compliance, indicating in particular whether appropriate remedial measures have been taken in the event of any deficiencies;

(c) persons in the compliance function are not involved in the performance of services or activities they monitor;

(d) the method of determining the remuneration of a compliance officer and other persons in the compliance function do not affect their objectivity and are not likely to do so.

However, the AIFM shall not be required to comply with point (c) or (d) of the first subparagraph where it is able to demonstrate that in view of the nature, scale and complexity of its business, and the nature and range of its services and activities, that the requirement is not proportionate and that its compliance function continues to be effective.
