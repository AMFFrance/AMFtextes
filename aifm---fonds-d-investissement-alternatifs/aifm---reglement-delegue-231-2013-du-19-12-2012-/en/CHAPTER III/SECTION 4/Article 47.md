# Article 47 - Monitoring and managing liquidity risk


1.   The liquidity management system and procedures referred to in Article 46 shall at least, ensure that:

(a) the AIFM maintains a level of liquidity in the AIF appropriate to its underlying obligations, based on an assessment of the relative liquidity of the AIF’s assets in the market, taking account of the time required for liquidation and the price or value at which those assets can be liquidated, and their sensitivity to other market risks or factors;

(b) the AIFM monitors the liquidity profile of the AIF’s portfolio of assets, having regard to the marginal contribution of individual assets which may have a material impact on liquidity, and the material liabilities and commitments, contingent or otherwise, which the AIF may have in relation to its underlying obligations. For these purposes the AIFM shall take into account the profile of the investor base of the AIF, including the type of investors, the relative size of investments and the redemption terms to which these investments are subject;

(c) the AIFM, where the AIF invests in other collective investment undertakings, monitors the approach adopted by the managers of those other collective investment undertakings to the management of liquidity, including through conducting periodic reviews to monitor changes to the redemption provisions of the underlying collective investment undertakings in which the AIF invests. Subject to Article 16(1) of Directive 2011/61/EU, this obligation shall not apply where the other collective investment undertakings in which the AIF invests are actively traded on a regulated market within the meaning of point (14) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2004/39/EC or an equivalent third country market;

(d) the AIFM implements and maintains appropriate liquidity measurement arrangements and procedures to assess the quantitative and qualitative risks of positions and of intended investments which have a material impact on the liquidity profile of the portfolio of the AIF’s assets to enable their effects on the overall liquidity profile to be appropriately measured. The procedures employed shall ensure that the AIFM has the appropriate knowledge and understanding of the liquidity of the assets in which the AIF has invested or intends to invest including, where applicable, the trading volume and sensitivity of prices and, as the case may be, or spreads of individual assets in normal and exceptional liquidity conditions;

(e) the AIFM considers and puts into effect the tools and arrangements, including special arrangements, necessary to manage the liquidity risk of each AIF under its management. The AIFM shall identify the types of circumstances where these tools and arrangements may be used in both normal and exceptional circumstances, taking into account the fair treatment of all AIF investors in relation to each AIF under management. The AIFM may use such tools and arrangements only in these circumstances and if appropriate disclosures have been made in accordance with Article 108.

2.   AIFMs shall document their liquidity management policies and procedures, as referred to in paragraph 1, review them on at least an annual basis and update them for any changes or new arrangements.

3.   AIFMs shall include appropriate escalation measures in their liquidity management system and procedures, as referred to in paragraph 1, to address anticipated or actual liquidity shortages or other distressed situations of the AIF.

4.   Where the AIFM manages an AIF which is a leveraged closed-ended AIF, point (e) of paragraph 1 shall not apply.
