(8) Data used by AIFMs to calculate the total value of assets under management do not need to be available to the public or to investors. However, competent authorities must be able to verify that the AIFM is correctly calculating and monitoring the total value of assets under management, including the assessment of occasions when the total value of assets under management temporarily exceeds the relevant threshold and should therefore have access to these data on request.
