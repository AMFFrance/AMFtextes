(125) It is necessary to set out a framework which provides for minimum standards with respect to annual reporting requirements, including key elements and a non-exhaustive list of items. Material changes in the information as referred to in Article 22(2)(d) of Directive 2011/61/EU should be disclosed in the annual report within the financial statements. In addition to the non-exhaustive list of underlying line items additional line items, headings and sub totals may be included where the presentation of these items is relevant for the understanding of an AIF’s overall financial position or performance. Items of a dissimilar nature or function could be aggregated provided such items are individually not materially relevant. Those items could be aggregated under ‘other category’ such as ‘other assets’ or ‘other liabilities’. Where line items do not apply to a particular AIF at all, they do not need to be presented. Regardless of the accounting standards followed in accordance with Directive 2011/61/EU, all assets should be valued at least once a year. The balance sheet or the statement of assets and liabilities under Directive 2011/61/EU should include, inter alia, cash and cash equivalents. Thus, cash equivalents should be considered highly liquid investments for the purpose of calculating the exposure of an AIF.
