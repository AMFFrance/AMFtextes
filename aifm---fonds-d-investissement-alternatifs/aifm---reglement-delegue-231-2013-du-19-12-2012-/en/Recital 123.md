(123) It is important for competent authorities to obtain appropriate and sufficient information in order to supervise activities of AIFMs and the risks related to them appropriately and consistently. Also, since the activities of AIFMs could have effects across borders and on the financial markets, competent authorities should monitor AIFMs and AIFs closely in order to take appropriate action to avoid the build-up of systemic risks. The increased transparency and consistency through provisions on reporting and disclosing relevant information as outlined in the implementing measures should make it possible for competent authorities to detect and respond to risks in the financial markets.
