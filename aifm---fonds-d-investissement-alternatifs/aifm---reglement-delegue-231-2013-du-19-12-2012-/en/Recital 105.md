(105) The depositary should keep a record of all assets for which it is satisfied that the AIF holds ownership. It may set up a procedure to receive information from third parties, whereby procedures which ensure that the assets could not be transferred without the depositary or the third party to whom safe-keeping functions are delegated having been informed of such transactions may be feasible in the case of AIFs with infrequent transactions and, as the case may be, or transactions which are subject to pre-settlement negotiation. The requirement to have access to documentary evidence of each transaction from a third party could be appropriate for AIFs with more frequent portfolio trading, such as investments in listed derivatives.
