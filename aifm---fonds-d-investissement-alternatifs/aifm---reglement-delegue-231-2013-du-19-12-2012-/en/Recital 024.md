(24) A merger arbitrage strategy is a strategy that combines a short position on a stock with a long position on another stock. Such a strategy aims to hedge the beta (market risk) of the positions and generate a return linked to the relative performance of both stocks. Similarly, the alpha component of the basket of shares may dominate over the beta component and as such lead to losses at the level of the AIF. It should not be considered as a hedging arrangement as laid down in the criteria related to the commitment method.
