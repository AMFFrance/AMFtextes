(108) The depositary should take all necessary steps to ensure that appropriate valuation policies and procedures for the assets of the AIF are effectively implemented, through the performance of sample checks or by comparing the consistency of the change in the NAV calculation over time with that of a benchmark. When setting up its procedures, the depositary should have a clear understanding of the valuation methodologies used by the AIFM or the external valuer to value the AIF’s assets. The frequency of such checks should be consistent with the frequency of the AIF’s asset valuation.
