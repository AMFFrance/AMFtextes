(59) Liquidity management systems and procedures can allow AIFMs to apply the tools and arrangements necessary to cope with illiquid assets and related valuation problems in order to respond to redemption requests. Such tools and arrangements may include, where allowed under national law, gates, partial redemptions, temporary borrowings, notice periods and pools of liquid assets. ‘Side pockets’ and other mechanisms where certain assets of the AIF are subject to similar arrangements between the AIF and its investors should be regarded as ‘special arrangements’ as they impact the specific redemption rights of investors in the AIF. The suspension of an AIF should not be considered as a special arrangement as this applies to all of the AIF’s assets and all of the AIF’s investors. The use of tools and special arrangements to manage liquidity should be made dependent on concrete circumstances and should vary according to the nature, scale and investment strategy of the AIF.
