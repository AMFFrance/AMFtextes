(b) the information received from third country authorities whenever this is necessary for the monitoring of systemic risks;

(c) the analysis of the information referred to in points (a) and (b) and the assessment of any situation in which the activities of one or more supervised AIFMs or of one or more AIFs under their management are considered to contribute to the build-up of systemic risk in the financial system, to the risk of disorderly markets or to risks for the long-term growth of the economy;

(d) the measures taken, when the activity of one or more supervised AIFMs or of one or more AIFs under their management present systemic risk or jeopardise the orderly functioning of the markets on which they are active.
