# Article 112 - Restrictions on the management of AIFs


1.   The principles laid down in this Article shall apply in order to specify the circumstances in which competent authorities exercise their power to impose leverage limits or other restrictions on AIFMs.

2.   When assessing the information received under Articles 7(3), 15(4), 24(4) or 24(5) of Directive 2011/61/EU, a competent authority shall take into account the extent to which the use of leverage by an AIFM or its interaction with a group of AIFMs or other financial institutions can contribute to the build-up of systemic risk in the financial system or risks creating disorderly markets.

3.   Competent authorities shall take into account at least the following aspects in their assessment:

(a) the circumstances in which the exposure of an AIF or several AIFs including those exposures resulting from financing or investment positions entered into by the AIFM for its own account or on behalf of the AIFs could constitute an important source of market, liquidity or counterparty risk to a financial institution;

(b) the circumstances in which the activities of an AIFM or its interaction with, for example, a group of AIFMs or other financial institutions, in particular with respect to the types of assets in which the AIF invests and the techniques employed by the AIFM through the use of leverage, contribute or could contribute to a downward spiral in the prices of financial instruments or other assets in a manner that threatens the viability of such financial instruments or other assets;

(c) criteria such as the type of AIF, the investment strategy of the AIFM with respect to the AIFs concerned, the market conditions in which the AIFM and the AIF operate and any likely pro-cyclical effects that could result from the imposition by the competent authorities of limits or other restrictions on the use of leverage by the AIFM concerned;

(d) criteria, such as the size of an AIF or several AIFs and any related impact in a particular market sector, concentrations of risks in particular markets in which the AIF or several AIFs are investing, any contagion risk to other markets from a market where risks have been identified, liquidity issues in particular markets at a given time, the scale of asset/liability mismatch in a particular AIFM investment strategy or irregular movements in the prices of assets in which an AIF may invest.
