(132) The threshold provided in this Regulation triggers only reporting requirements laid down in Article 24(4) of Directive 2011/61/EU. An AIF with a leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the commitment method of less than three times its net asset value would not be considered as employing leverage on a substantial basis. However, competent authorities may request additional information where necessary for the effective monitoring of systemic risks. Setting a reporting threshold also ensures that information relating to the build-up of systemic risk is collected throughout the Union in a consistent way and provides certainty to AIFMs.
