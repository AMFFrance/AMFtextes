(33) To ensure a common understanding of the general specification, a list of examples should serve as benchmark for identifying potential professional liability risk events. That list should include a wide range of events resulting from negligent actions, errors or omissions, such as the loss of documents evidencing title to investments, misrepresentations, or breach of the various obligations or duties incumbent on the AIFM. It should also include the failure to prevent, by means of adequate internal control systems, fraudulent behaviour within the AIFM’s organisation. Damage resulting from failure to carry out sufficient due diligence on an investment that turned out to be fraudulent would trigger the AIFM’s liability for professional liability and should be appropriately covered. However, losses incurred because an investment has lost value as a result of adverse market conditions should not be covered. The list should also include valuations that are improperly carried out, which should be understood as a valuation failure breaching Article 19 of Directive 2011/61/EU and the corresponding delegated acts.
