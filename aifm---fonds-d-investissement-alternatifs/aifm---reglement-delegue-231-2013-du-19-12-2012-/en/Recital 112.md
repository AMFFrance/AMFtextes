(112) When delegating safe-keeping functions, the depositary should ensure that the requirements of Article 21(11)(d)(iii) of Directive 2011/61/EU are fulfilled and that the assets of the AIF clients of the depositary are properly segregated. This obligation should particularly ensure that assets of the AIF are not lost due to insolvency of the third party to whom safekeeping functions are delegated. In order to minimise that risk in countries where the effects of segregation are not recognised by insolvency law, the depositary should take further steps. The depositary could make a disclosure to the AIF and the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF so that such aspects of the custody risk are properly taken into account in the investment decision or take such measures as are possible in the local jurisdictions to make the assets as insolvency-proof as possible according to local law. Furthermore, the depositary could prohibit temporary deficits in client assets, use buffers or put in place arrangements prohibiting the use of a debit balance for one client to offset a credit balance for another. While such measures may reduce the custody risk faced by a depositary when delegating custody functions, they do not alter the obligation to return the financial instruments or pay the corresponding amount where these are lost, which depends on whether or not the requirements of Directive 2011/61/EU are fulfilled.
