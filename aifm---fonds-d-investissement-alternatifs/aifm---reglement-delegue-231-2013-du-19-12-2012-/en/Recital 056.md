(56) For consistency reasons, the requirements relating to identification, measuring and monitoring of risk are built on similar provisions of Directive 2010/43/EU. AIFMs should deal appropriately with the possible vulnerability of their risk measurement techniques and models by carrying out stress tests, back tests and scenario analysis. Where stress tests and scenario analysis reveal particular vulnerability to a given set of circumstances, AIFMs should take prompt steps and corrective actions.
