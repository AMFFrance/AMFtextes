(37) In order to allow some flexibility when devising appropriate professional indemnity insurance, it should be possible for the AIFM and the insurance undertaking to agree on a clause providing that a defined amount will be borne by the AIFM as the first part of any loss (defined excess). Where such a defined excess is agreed, the AIFM should provide own funds corresponding to the defined amount of loss to be borne by the AIFM. Such own funds should be in addition to the initial capital of the AIFM and to the own funds to be provided by the AIFM pursuant to Article 9(3) of Directive 2011/61/EU.
