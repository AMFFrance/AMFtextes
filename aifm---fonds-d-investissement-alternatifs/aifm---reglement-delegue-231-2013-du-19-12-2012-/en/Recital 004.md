(4) Directive 2011/61/EU provides for a lighter regime applicable to those AIFMs who manage portfolios of AIFs whose total assets under management do not exceed the relevant thresholds. It is necessary to specify clearly how the total value of assets under management should be calculated. In this context it is essential to define the steps necessary for calculating the total value of assets, to determine clearly which assets are not included in the calculation, to clarify how the assets acquired through the use of leverage should be valued and to provide rules for handling of cases of cross-holding among AIFs managed by an AIFM.
