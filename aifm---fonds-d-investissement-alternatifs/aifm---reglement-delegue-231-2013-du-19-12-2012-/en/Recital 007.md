(7) Where an AIFM no longer meets the conditions related to the thresholds it should notify its competent authority and apply for an authorisation within 30 calendar days. However, where exceeding or falling below the thresholds occurs only occasionally within a given calendar year and such situations are considered as temporary the AIFM should not be obliged to make an application for authorisation. In those cases, the AIFM should inform the competent authority of the breach of the threshold, and explain why it considers such breach to be of a temporary nature. A situation lasting for more than three months cannot be considered as being temporary. When assessing the likelihood of a situation to be temporary, the AIFM should consider anticipated subscription and redemption activity or, where applicable, capital draw-downs and distribution. The AIFM should not use anticipated market movements as part of this assessment.
