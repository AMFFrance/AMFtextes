(82) The strict requirements and limitations which have to be complied with when an AIFM intends to delegate the task of carrying out functions are set out in Directive 2011/61/EU. The AIFM remains at all times fully responsible for the proper performance of the delegated tasks and their compliance with Directive 2011/61/EU and its implementing measures. The AIFM should therefore ensure that the delegate performs and applies the quality standards which would be applied by the AIFM itself. Also, if necessary to ensure that delegated functions are performed to a consistently high standard, the AIFM has to be able to terminate the delegation and the delegation arrangement should therefore confer flexible termination rights on the AIFM. The delegation limitations and requirements should apply to the management functions set out in Annex I to Directive 2011/61/EU, whereas supporting tasks like administrative or technical functions assisting the management tasks such as logistical support in the form of cleaning, catering and procurement of basic services or products, should not be deemed to constitute delegation of AIFM functions. Other examples of technical or administrative functions are buying standard software ‘off-the-shelf’ and relying on software providers for ad hoc operational assistance in relation to off-the-shelf systems or providing human resources support such as sourcing of temporary employees or processing of payroll.
