(2) Directive 2011/61/EU provides for a procedure for authorisation of AIFMs. The documents and information to be provided under that procedure offer necessary details as to the requesting AIFM and therefore the same documents and procedure should be used in the case of opting in. There are no specific reasons peculiar to opting in that would justify the use of a different procedure than the one applicable to AIFMs with assets under management above the thresholds provided for in Article 3(2) of Directive 2011/61/EU. Consequently, AIFMs choosing to opt in under Directive 2011/61/EU should follow the same procedure as that established for AIFMs that are obliged to seek authorisation under Directive 2011/61/EU.
