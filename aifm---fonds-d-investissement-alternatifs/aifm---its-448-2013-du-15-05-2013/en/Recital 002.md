(2) The procedure for determining the Member State of reference is different from the procedure for applying for a passport under Directive 2011/61/EU. Once the Member State of reference has been determined the non-EU AIFM concerned has to apply for authorisation to the competent authority of that Member State, following the same procedure and subject to the same conditions as applicable to AIFMs under Articles 7 and 8 of Directive 2011/61/EU.
