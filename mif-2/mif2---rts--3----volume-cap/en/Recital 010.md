(10) For the purpose of the volume cap mechanism, trading venues and CTPs should ensure that the trading venue on which the transaction was executed is identified with sufficient granularity to allow ESMA to perform all calculations referred to in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014. In particular, the trading venue identifier used should be unique for that trading venue and not shared with any other trading venue operated by the same market operator. Trading venue identifiers should allow ESMA to distinguish in an unequivocal manner all trading venues for which the market operator has received a specific authorisation under Directive 2014/65/EU.
