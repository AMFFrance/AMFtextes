(13) The provisions in this Regulation are closely linked, since they deal with specifying the content, frequency, format of data requests, the method to be used to process this data and other specifications relating to the publication of information for the purposes of transparency as defined under Regulation (EU) No 600/2014. To ensure coherence between those provisions, which will enter into force at the same time, and to facilitate a comprehensive view for stakeholders, and in particular those subject to the obligations, it is desirable to include them in a single Regulation.
