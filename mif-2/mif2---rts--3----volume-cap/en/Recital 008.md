(8) Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 requires ESMA to publish, for financial instruments to which the volume cap mechanism applies, measurements of the total volume of trading in the previous 12 months and of the percentages of trading under both the negotiated trade and reference price waivers across the Union and on each trading venue in the previous 12 months. In case of financial instruments traded in more than one currency, it is necessary to convert the volumes executed in different currencies into one common currency so as to enable the computation of those volumes and make the required calculations. Therefore, the methodology and exchange rates to be used to convert, where necessary, trading volumes should be provided for.
