(2) In order to perform the necessary calculations, both competent authorities and ESMA need to be able to obtain robust and high quality data for each asset class to which Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 applies. It is therefore necessary to improve both the accessibility and the quality of data available to competent authorities and ESMA in accordance with Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 so that the classification of financial instruments, including the thresholds for the purposes of pre-trade and post-trade transparency, and, where necessary, re-calibrations of these thresholds, can be calculated on a more informed basis after the regime has been applied for a certain period of time.
