# Article 17 - Periodic review of business continuity arrangements


1.   Trading venues shall, in the context of their self-assessment in accordance with Article 2, test on the basis of realistic scenarios the operation of the business continuity plan and verify the capability of the trading venue to recover from disruptive incidents and to resume trading as set out in Article 15(2).

2.   Trading venues shall, where considered necessary, having regard to the results of the periodic review in accordance with paragraph 1, ensure that a review of their business continuity plan and arrangements is carried out by either an independent assessor or a department within the trading venue other than the one responsible for the function under review. The results of the testing activity shall be documented in writing, stored and submitted to the trading venue's senior management as well as to the operating units involved in the business continuity plan.

3.   Trading venues shall ensure that testing of the business continuity plan does not interfere with normal trading activity.
