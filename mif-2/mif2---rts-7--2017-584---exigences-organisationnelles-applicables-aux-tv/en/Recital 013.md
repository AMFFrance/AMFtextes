(13) Trading venues should be subject to an obligation to provide means to facilitate testing against disorderly trading conditions. However, their members should not be required to use those means. It should be considered as a sufficient guarantee if trading venues receive a declaration from their members confirming that such testing has taken place and stating the means used for that testing, but the trading venues should not be obliged to validate the adequacy of those means or the outcome of that testing.
