(7) Many market participants trade package orders consisting of two contracts with a different expiry date. In particular, roll forwards are highly standardised and frequently traded. Those package orders are used to replace a position in a contract that is nearest to expiry with a position in a contract expiring at the next maturity date, thereby allowing market participants to maintain an investment position beyond the initial expiration of a contract. It is therefore appropriate to consider that there is a liquid market for those package orders as a whole.
