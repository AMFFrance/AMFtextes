(2) The determination of the classes of derivative subject to the trading obligation under Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 requires derivatives within those classes to be standardised and sufficiently liquid. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider that there is a liquid market for the package order as a whole where all the components of that package order are of the same asset class and are subject to the trading obligation. However, package orders where all components are above a certain size or which include a large number of components are not considered as sufficiently standardised or liquid. It is therefore appropriate to specify that package orders where all components are subject to the trading obligation should be considered as having a liquid market where the package order is composed of no more than four components or where not all components within the package order are above a size that is large in scale compared to normal market size.
