(1) Package orders are common in all asset classes and may include many different components within the same asset class or across different asset classes. Package orders may therefore comprise an unlimited number of combinations of components. Accordingly, it is appropriate to adopt a holistic approach in establishing qualitative criteria to identify those package orders which should be considered as standardised and frequently traded and therefore, as a whole, having a liquid market. To take into account the characteristics of the different types of package order, those qualitative criteria should include general criteria applicable across all asset classes, as well as specific criteria applicable to the different asset classes comprising a package order.
