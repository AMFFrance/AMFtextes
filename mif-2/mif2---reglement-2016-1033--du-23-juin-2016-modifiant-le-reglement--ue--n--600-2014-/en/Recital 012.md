(12) Investment firms often execute, on their own account or on behalf of clients, transactions in derivatives and other financial instruments or assets that comprise a number of interlinked, contingent trades. Such package transactions enable investment firms and their clients to better manage their risks, with the price of each component of the package transaction reflecting the overall risk profile of the package rather than the prevailing market price of each component. Package transactions can take various forms, such as exchange for physicals, trading strategies executed on trading venues, or bespoke package transactions, and it is important to take those specificities into account when calibrating the applicable transparency regime. It is therefore appropriate to specify for the purpose of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 the specific circumstances in which pre-trade transparency requirements should not apply to orders relating to such package transactions, nor to any individual component of such orders.
