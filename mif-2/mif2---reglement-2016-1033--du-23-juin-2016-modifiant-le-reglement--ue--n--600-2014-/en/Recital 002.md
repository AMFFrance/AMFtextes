(2) The new legal framework governs the requirements applicable to investment firms, regulated markets, data reporting services providers and third country firms providing investment services or activities in the Union. It harmonises the position limits regime for commodity derivatives to improve transparency, to support orderly pricing and to prevent market abuse. It also introduces rules on high-frequency algorithmic trading and improves the oversight of financial markets by harmonising administrative sanctions. Building on the rules already in place, the new legal framework also strengthens the protection of investors by introducing robust organisational and conduct requirements. The new rules are to apply from 3 January 2017.
