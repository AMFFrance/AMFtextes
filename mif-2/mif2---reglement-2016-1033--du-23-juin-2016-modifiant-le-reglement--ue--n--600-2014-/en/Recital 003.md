(3) The new legal framework requires trading venues and systematic internalisers to provide competent authorities with financial instrument reference data that describe in a uniform manner the characteristics of every financial instrument that is subject to Directive 2014/65/EU. Those data are also used for other purposes, for instance for the calculation of transparency and liquidity thresholds, as well as for the reporting of positions in commodity derivatives.
