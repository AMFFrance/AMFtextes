(4) In order to collect data in an efficient and harmonised manner, a new data collection infrastructure, the Financial Instruments Reference Data System (‘FIRDS’), is being developed by the European Securities and Markets Authority (‘ESMA’) in conjunction with national competent authorities (‘NCAs’). FIRDS will cover a wide range of financial instruments brought into the scope of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and it will link data feeds between ESMA, NCAs and trading venues across the Union. The vast majority of the new IT-systems underpinning FIRDS will need to be built from scratch, based on new parameters.
