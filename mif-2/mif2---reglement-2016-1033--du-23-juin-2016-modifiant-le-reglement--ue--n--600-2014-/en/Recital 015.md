(15) Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) establishes requirements regarding the collection of financial instrument reference data. Those data, that are collected via FIRDS, are used to determine the financial instruments that fall within the scope of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014. Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 applies from 3 July 2016. However, FIRDS will not be fully operational before January 2018. It is therefore appropriate to defer the date of application of Article 4(2) and (3) of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 until 3 January 2018.
