(5) Given the complexity of the new legal framework and the need for a very high number of delegated and implementing acts, the date of applicability of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 was deferred by 30 months from the date of entry into force. Despite this unusually long period, stakeholders, such as trading platforms, NCAs and ESMA are not in a position to ensure that the necessary data collection infrastructures will be in place and become operational by 3 January 2017. This is due to the size and complexity of the data needed to be collected and processed for the new legal framework to become operational, in particular for transaction reporting, transparency calculations and the reporting of positions in commodity derivatives.
