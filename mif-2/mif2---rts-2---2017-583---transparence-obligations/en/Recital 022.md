(22) The purpose of the exemption from transparency obligations set out in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 is to ensure that the effectiveness of operations conducted by the Eurosystem in the performance of primary tasks as set out in the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank annexed to the Treaty on the European Union (‘the Statute’), and under equivalent national provisions for members of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) in Member States whose currency is not the euro, which relies on timely and confidential transactions, is not compromised by the disclosure of information on such transactions. It is crucial for central banks to be able to control whether, when and how information about their actions is disclosed so as to maximise the intended impact and limit any unintended impact on the market. Therefore, legal certainty should be provided for the members of the ESCB and their respective counterparties as to the scope of the exemption from transparency requirements.
