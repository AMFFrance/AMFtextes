(5) It is appropriate to clarify a limited number of technical terms. Those technical definitions are necessary to ensure the uniform application in the Union of the provisions contained in this Regulation and, hence, contribute to the establishment of a single rulebook for Union financial markets. Those definitions serve only for the purpose of setting out the transparency obligations for non-equity financial instruments and should be strictly limited to understanding this Regulation.
