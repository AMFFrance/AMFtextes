After being notified of a temporary halt in trading, the competent authority is obliged to assess whether that notification is to be disseminated to the rest of the market and to coordinate, where necessary, a market-wide response. In order to limit the administrative burden for trading venues, only the trading venues with the greatest potential for market wide impact when trading is halted should be subject to the notification obligation.
