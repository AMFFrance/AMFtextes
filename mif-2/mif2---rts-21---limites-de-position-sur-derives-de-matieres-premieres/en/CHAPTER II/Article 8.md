2.   The person referred to in paragraph 1 shall submit to the competent authority the following information which demonstrates how the position reduces risks directly relating to the non-financial entity's commercial activity:

(a) a description of the nature and value of the non-financial entity's commercial activities in the commodity to which the commodity derivative for which an exemption is sought is relevant;

(b) a description of the nature and value of the non-financial entity's activities in the trading of and positions held in the relevant commodity derivatives traded on trading venues and in their economically equivalent OTC contracts;

(c) a description of the nature and size of the exposures and risks in the commodity which the non-financial entity has or expects to have as a result of its commercial activities and which are or would be mitigated by the use of commodity derivatives;

(d) an explanation of how the non-financial entity's use of commodity derivatives directly reduces its exposure and risks in its commercial activities.

3.   The competent authority shall approve or reject the application within 21 calendar days after it has received the application and shall notify the non-financial entity of its approval or rejection of the exemption.

4.   The non-financial entity shall notify the competent authority if there is a significant change to the nature or value of the non-financial entity's commercial activities or its trading activities in commodity derivatives and the change is relevant to the information set out in point (b) of paragraph 2 and shall submit a new application for the exemption if it intends to continue to use it.
