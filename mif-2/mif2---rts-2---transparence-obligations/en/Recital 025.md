(25) The temporary suspension of transparency obligations should only be imposed in exceptional situations which represent a significant decline in liquidity across a class of financial instruments based on objective and measurable factors. It is necessary to differentiate between classes initially determined as having or not having a liquid market as a further significant decline in relative terms in a class already determined as illiquid is likely to occur more easily. Therefore, a suspension of transparency requirements in instruments determined as not having a liquid market should be imposed only if a decline by a higher relative threshold has occurred.
