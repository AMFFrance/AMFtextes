(26) The pre-trade and post-trade transparency regime established by Regulation (EU) NoÂ 600/2014 should be appropriately calibrated to the market and applied in a uniform manner throughout the Union. It is therefore essential to lay down the necessary calculations to be performed, including the periods and methods of calculation. In this respect, to avoid market distorting effects, the calculation periods specified in this Regulation should ensure that the relevant thresholds of the regime are updated at appropriate intervals to reflect market conditions. It is also appropriate to provide for the centralised publication of the results of the calculations so that they are made available to all financial market participants and competent authorities in the Union in a single place and in a user-friendly manner. To that end, competent authorities should notify ESMA of the results of their calculations and ESMA should publish those calculations on its website.
