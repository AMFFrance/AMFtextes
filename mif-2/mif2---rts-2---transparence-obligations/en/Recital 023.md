(23) One of the primary ESCB responsibilities under the Treaty and the Statute and under equivalent national provisions for members of the ESCB in Member States whose currency is not the euro, is the performance of foreign exchange policy, which entails holding and managing foreign reserves to ensure that, whenever necessary, there is a sufficient amount of liquid resources available for its foreign exchange policy operations. The application of transparency requirements to foreign reserve management operations may result in unintended signals to the market, which could interfere with the foreign exchange policy of the Eurosystem and of members of the ESCB in Member States whose currency is not the euro. Similar considerations may also apply to foreign reserve management operations in the performance of monetary and financial stability policy on a case-by-case basis.
