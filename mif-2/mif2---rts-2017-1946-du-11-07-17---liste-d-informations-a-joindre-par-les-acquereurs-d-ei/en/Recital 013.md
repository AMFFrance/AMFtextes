(13) Proposed acquirers holding a qualifying holding of between 20 % and up to 50 % in the target entity should provide information on strategy to the competent authority of the target entity in order to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the proposed acquisition. Similarly, proposed acquirers holding a qualifying holding of less than 20 % in the target entity but exercising an equivalent influence over it through other means such as the relationships between the proposed acquirer and the existing shareholders, the existence of shareholders' agreements, the distribution of shares, participating interests and voting rights across shareholders or the proposed acquirer's position within the group structure of the target entity should also provide that information to ensure a high degree of homogeneity in assessing proposed acquisitions.
