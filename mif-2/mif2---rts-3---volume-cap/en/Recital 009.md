(9) For the purpose of the volume cap mechanism, trading venues should be required to report the volumes of trading executed under the reference price waiver and, for liquid instruments, the negotiated trade waiver. Given that the waivers apply to orders and not to transactions, it is important to clarify that the volumes to be reported should include all transactions flagged with ‘RFPT’ or ‘NLIQ’ for the purpose of the post-trade publication of transactions and as specified in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/587. Where a transaction was executed on the basis of two orders benefitting from the large in scale waiver, this transaction should not count towards the volumes calculated under the reference price waiver and the negotiated trade waiver.
