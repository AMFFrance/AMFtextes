(2) The number of orders received every second by a trading venue can be very high, much higher than that of executed transactions. This may extend to several thousands of orders per second depending on the trading venue, the type of members or participants or clients of a given trading venue, and the financial instruments' volatility and liquidity. As a result, a time granularity of one second would not be sufficient for the purposes of effective market manipulation surveillance of certain types of trading activities. Therefore, it is necessary to establish minimum granularity requirements for recording the date and time of reportable events by operators of trading venues and their members or participants.
