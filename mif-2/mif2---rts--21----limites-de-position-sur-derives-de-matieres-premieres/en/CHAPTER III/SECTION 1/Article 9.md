# Article 9 - Methodology for determining the baseline figure for spot month limits


1.   Competent authorities shall determine a baseline figure for the spot month position limit in a commodity derivative by calculating 25 % of the deliverable supply for that commodity derivative.

2.   The baseline figure shall be specified in lots which shall be the unit of trading used by the trading venue on which the commodity derivative trades representing a standardised quantity of the underlying commodity.

3.   Where a competent authority establishes different position limits for different times within the spot month period, those position limits shall decrease on an incremental basis towards the maturity of the commodity derivative and shall take into account the position management arrangements of the trading venue.

4.   By way of derogation to paragraph 1, competent authorities shall determine the baseline figure for the spot month position limit for any derivative contract with an underlying that qualifies as food intended for human consumption with a total combined open interest in spot and other months' contracts exceeding 50 000 lots over a consecutive three month period by calculating 20 % of the deliverable supply in that commodity derivative.
