(5) In order to avoid non-reporting or double reporting by investment firms that transmit orders to each other, the investment firm that intends to transmit the order should agree with the firm receiving the order whether the receiving firm will report all the details of the resulting transaction or transmit the order onwards to another investment firm. In the absence of an agreement, the order should be deemed not transmitted and each investment firm should submit its own transaction report containing [all] the details that pertain to the transaction that each investment firm is reporting. Moreover, the details relating to the order to be transmitted between firms should be specified in order to ensure that the competent authorities receive information that is relevant, accurate and complete.
