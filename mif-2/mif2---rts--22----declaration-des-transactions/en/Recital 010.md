(10) The persons or computer algorithms responsible for determining the venue to access or an investment firm to which the orders are to be transmitted or any other conditions related to the execution of the order may thereby be responsible for market abuse. Therefore, in order to ensure effective market surveillance, a person or computer algorithm within the investment firm that is responsible for such activities should be identified in the transaction report. Where both a person and computer algorithm are involved, or more than one person or algorithm is involved, the investment firm should determine, on a consistent basis following predetermined criteria, which person or algorithm is primarily responsible for those activities.
