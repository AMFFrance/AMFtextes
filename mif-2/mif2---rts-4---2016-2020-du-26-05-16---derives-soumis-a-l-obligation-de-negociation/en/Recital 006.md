(6) The observation period for determining whether a class of derivatives or relevant subset thereof is sufficiently liquid to trade exclusively on trading venues should vary depending on the class of derivatives or relevant subset thereof concerned. It should be sufficiently long to ensure that the data collected is not skewed by any type of events that may cause unusual trading patterns. In any circumstance the observation period should not be shorter than three months.
