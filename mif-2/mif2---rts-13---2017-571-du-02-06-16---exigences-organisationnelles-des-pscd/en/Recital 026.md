(26) CTPs may publish information on equity and non-equity instruments. Given the different requirements for the operation of those tapes, and in particular the significantly broader scope of financial instruments covered for non-equity instruments and the deferred application of the provisions of Directive 2014/65/EU for the non-equity consolidated tape, this Regulation only specifies the scope of the CTP consolidating information on equity-instruments.
