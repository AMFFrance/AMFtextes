(15) Where an ARM itself causes an error or omission, it should correct this information without delay as well as notify the competent authority of its home Member State and any competent authority to which it submits reports of the error or omission as those competent authorities have an interest in the quality of the data being submitted to them. The ARM should also notify its client of the error or omission and provide updated information to the client so that the client's internal records may be aligned with the information which the ARM has submitted to the competent authority on the client's behalf.
