(6) The IT systems used by a data reporting services provider should be well adapted to the different types of activities those entities may perform, that is to publish trade reports, submit transaction reports or provide a consolidated tape, and robust enough to ensure continuity and regularity in the provision of those services. This includes ensuring that the data reporting services provider's IT systems are able to handle fluctuations in the amount of data which it must handle. Such fluctuations, particularly unexpected increases in data flow, may adversely impact the effectiveness of the data reporting services provider's systems and as a result, its ability to publish or report complete and accurate information within the required timeframes. In order to handle this, a data reporting services provider should periodically test its systems to ensure that they are robust enough to handle changes in operating conditions and sufficiently scalable.
