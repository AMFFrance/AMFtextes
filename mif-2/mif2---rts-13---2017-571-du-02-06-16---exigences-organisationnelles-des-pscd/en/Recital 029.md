(29) For reasons of consistency and in order to ensure the smooth functioning of the financial markets, it is necessary that the provisions laid down in this Regulation and the related national provisions transposing Directive 2014/65/EU apply from the same date. As Article 65(2) of Directive 2014/65/EU applies from 3 September of the year after the year of entry into application of this Regulation, certain provisions of this Regulation should apply from that later date.
