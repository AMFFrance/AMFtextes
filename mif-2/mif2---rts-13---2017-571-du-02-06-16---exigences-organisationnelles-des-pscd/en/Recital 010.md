(10) The deployment of any IT systems' updates may potentially impact the effectiveness and robustness of the systems used for data service provision. To prevent that the operation of its IT system is at any time incompatible with its regulatory obligations, in particular that of having a sound security mechanism in place designed to guarantee the security of the means of transfer of information, minimise the risk of data corruption and to prevent information leakage before publication, a data reporting services provider should make use of clearly delineated development and testing methodologies to ensure that compliance and risk management controls embedded in the systems work as intended and that the system can continue to work effectively in all conditions. Where a data reporting services provider undertakes a significant system change, it should notify the competent authority of its home Member State and other competent authorities, where relevant, so they can assess whether the update will impact their own systems and whether the conditions for authorisation continue to be met.
