(14) A data reporting services provider should monitor that the data it is publishing or submitting is accurate and complete and should ensure that it has mechanisms for detecting errors or omissions caused by the client or itself. In the case of an ARM, this can include reconciliations of a sample population of data submitted to the ARM by an investment firm or generated by the ARM on the investment firm's behalf with the corresponding data provided by the competent authority. The frequency and extent of such reconciliations should be proportionate to the volume of data handled by the ARM and the extent to which it is generating transaction reports from clients' data or passing on transaction reports completed by clients. In order to ensure timely reporting that is free of errors and omissions an ARM should continuously monitor the performance of its systems.
