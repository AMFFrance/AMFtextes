(27) The provisions in this Regulation are closely linked, since they deal with the authorisation, organisational requirements and the publication of transactions for data reporting services providers. To ensure coherence between those provisions, which should enter into force at the same time, and to facilitate a comprehensive view by stakeholders and, in particular those subject to the obligations, it is necessary to include these regulatory technical standards in a single Regulation.
