(3) Conflicts of interest can arise between the data reporting services provider and clients using its services to meet their regulatory obligations and other entities purchasing data from data reporting services providers. In particular, those conflicts may arise where the data reporting services provider is engaged in other activities such as acting as a market operator, investment firm or trade repository. If conflicts are left unaddressed, this could lead to a situation where the data reporting services provider has an incentive to delay publication or submission of data or to trade on the basis of the confidential information it has received. The data reporting services provider should therefore adopt a comprehensive approach to identifying, preventing and managing existing and potential conflicts of interest, including preparing an inventory of conflicts of interest and implementing appropriate policies and procedures to manage those conflicts and, where necessary, separate business functions and personnel to limit the flow of sensitive information between different business areas of the data reporting services provider.
