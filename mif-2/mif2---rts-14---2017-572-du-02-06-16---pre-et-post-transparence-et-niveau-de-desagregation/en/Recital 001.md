(1) In order to reduce costs for market participants when purchasing data, Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 provides for pre-trade and post-trade transparency data to be made available to the public in an ‘unbundled’ fashion for separate data items. It is necessary to specify the level of disaggregation by which venues should offer data. Taking into account the evidence of demand for such data from other stakeholders, market operators and investment firms operating a trading venue should disaggregate data by asset class, by country of issue, by the currency in which a financial instrument is traded, and according to whether data comes from scheduled daily auctions or from continuous trading.
