(5) Article 32(2) and Article 52(2) of Directive 2014/65/EU should be applied consistently to different types of trading venues. They are closely linked, since they deal with specifying the suspensions and removals on different types of trading venues. To ensure consistent application of these provisions which should enter into force at the same time, and to facilitate a comprehensive view for stakeholders and, in particular, those subject to the obligations, it is necessary to consolidate the regulatory technical standards developed under Article 32(2) and Article 52(2) of Directive 2014/65/EU in a single Regulation.
