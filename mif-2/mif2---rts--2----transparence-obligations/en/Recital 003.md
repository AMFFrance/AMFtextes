(3) The provisions in this Regulation are closely linked, since they deal with specifying the pre-trade and post-trade transparency requirements that apply to trading in non-equity financial instruments. To ensure coherence between those provisions, which should enter into force at the same time, and to facilitate a comprehensive view for stakeholders and, in particular, those subject to the obligations, it is necessary to include these regulatory technical standards in a single Regulation.
