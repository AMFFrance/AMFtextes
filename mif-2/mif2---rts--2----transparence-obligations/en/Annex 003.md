# ANNEX III

## Liquidity assessment, LIS and SSTI thresholds for non-equity financial instruments

## 1.   Instructions for the purpose of this annex

1. A reference to an ‘asset class’ means a reference to the following classes of financial instruments: bonds, structured finance products, securitised derivatives, interest rate derivatives, equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, foreign exchange derivatives, credit derivatives, C10 derivatives, CFDs, emission allowances and emission allowance derivatives.

2. A reference to a ‘sub-asset class’ means a reference to an asset class segmented to a more granular level on the basis of the contract type and/or the type of underlying.

3. A reference to a ‘sub-class’ means a reference to a sub-asset class segmented to a more granular level on basis of further qualitative segmentation criteria as set out in Tables 2.1 to 13.3 of this Annex.

4. ‘Average daily turnover (ADT)’ means the total turnover for a particular financial instrument determined according to the volume measure set out in Table 4 of Annex II and executed in the period set out in Article 13(7), divided by the number of trading days in that period or, where applicable, that part of the year during which the financial instrument was admitted to trading or traded on a trading venue and was not suspended from trading.

5. ‘Average daily notional amount (ADNA)’ means the total notional amount for a particular financial instrument determined according to the volume measure set out in Table 4 of Annex II and executed in the period set out in Article 13(18) for all bonds except ETCs and ETNs and in Article 13(7) for all the other financial instruments, divided by the number of trading days in that period or, where applicable, that part of the year during which the financial instrument was admitted to trading or traded on a trading venue and was not suspended from trading.

6. ‘Percentage of days traded over the period considered’ means the number of days in the period set out in Article 13(18) for all bonds except ETCs and ETNs and in Article 13(7) for structured finance products, on which at least one transaction has been executed for that financial instrument, divided by the number of trading days in that period or, where applicable, that part of the year during which the financial instrument was admitted to trading or traded on a trading venue and was not suspended from trading.

7. ‘Average daily number of trades’ means the total number of transactions executed for a particular financial instrument in the period set out in Article 13(18) for all bonds except ETCs and ETN and in Article 13(7) all the other financial instruments, divided by the number of trading days in that period or, where applicable, that part of the year during which the financial instrument was admitted to trading or traded on a trading venue and was not suspended from trading.

8. ‘Future’ means a contract to buy or sell a commodity or financial instrument in a designated future date at a price agreed upon at the initiation of the contract by the buyer and seller. Every futures contract has standard terms that dictate the minimum quantity and quality that can be bought or sold, the smallest amount by which the price may change, delivery procedures, maturity date and other characteristics related to the contract.

9. ‘Option’ means a contract that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a specific financial instrument or commodity at a predetermined price, strike or exercise price, at or up to a certain future date or exercise date.

10. ‘Swap’ means a contract in which two parties agree to exchange cash flows in one financial instrument for those of another financial instrument at a certain future date.

11. ‘Portfolio Swap’ means a contract by which end-users can trade multiple swaps.

12. ‘Forward’ or ‘Forward agreement’ means a private agreement between two parties to buy or sell a commodity or financial instrument at a designated future date at a price agreed upon at the initiation of the contract by the buyer and seller.

13. ‘Swaption’ means a contract that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to enter a swap at or up to a certain future date or exercise date.

14. ‘Future on a swap’ means a future contract that gives the owner the obligation, to enter a swap at or up to a certain future date.

15. ‘Forward on a swap’ means a forward contract that gives the owner the obligation, to enter a swap at or up to a certain future date.
