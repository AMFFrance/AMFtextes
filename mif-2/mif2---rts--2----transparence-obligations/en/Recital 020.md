(20) In order to ensure consistent application of the waivers to pre-trade transparency and the post-trade deferrals, it is necessary to create uniform rules regarding the content and frequency of data competent authorities may request from trading venues, APAs and consolidated tape providers (CTPs) for transparency purposes. It is also necessary to specify the methodology for calculating the respective thresholds and to create uniform rules with regard to publishing the information across the Union. Rules on the specific methodology and data necessary to perform calculations for the purpose of specifying the transparency regime applicable to non-equity financial instruments should be applied in conjunction with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/577 (3) which sets out the common elements with regard to the content and frequency of data requests to be addressed to trading venues, APAs and CTPs for the purposes of transparency and other calculations in more general terms.
