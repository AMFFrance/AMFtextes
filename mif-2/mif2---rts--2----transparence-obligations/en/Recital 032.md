(32) In the determination of financial instruments not having a liquid market in relation to foreign exchange derivatives, a qualitative assessment was required due to the lack of data necessary for a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the entire market. As a result, until data of better quality is available, foreign exchange derivatives should be considered not to have a liquid market for the purposes of this Regulation.
