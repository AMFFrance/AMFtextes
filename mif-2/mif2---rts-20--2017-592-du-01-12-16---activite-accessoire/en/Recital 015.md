(15) Transactions objectively measurable as reducing risks directly relating to commercial activity or treasury financing activity and intra-group transactions should be considered in a way consistent with Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3). However, in relation to transactions in derivatives which are objectively measurable as reducing risks directly relating to the commercial activity or treasury financing activity Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 149/2013 (4) only refers to derivatives not traded on regulated markets while Article 2(4) of Directive 2014/65/EU covers derivatives traded on trading venues. Therefore, this Regulation should also take into account derivatives traded on regulated markets in relation to transactions that are deemed to be objectively measurable as reducing risks directly related to commercial or treasury financing activity.
