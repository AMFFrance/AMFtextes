(11) The second method under the second test uses the estimated capital that a non-financial group would be required to hold against the market risk inherent in its positions arising from trading in commodity derivatives, emission allowances and derivatives thereof, other than those from privileged transactions, as a proxy for the amount of ancillary activities undertaken by the persons in a group. The framework developed under the auspices of the Basel Committee and implemented in the Union through the Capital Requirements Directive is used to apply a proportionate notional capital weighting to positions. Within this framework, the net position in a commodity derivative, emission allowance or derivative thereof shall be determined by netting long and short positions in a particular type of commodity derivative contract, emission allowance or derivative contract thereof, such as a future, option, forward or warrants. In determining the net position, netting should take place irrespective of where the contract is traded, the contract's counterparty or its maturity. The gross position in a relevant commodity derivative, emission allowance contract or a derivative contract thereof should, on the other hand, be calculated by adding the net positions of types of contracts that relate to a particular commodity or, emission allowance or derivative thereof. In this context, net positons in a particular type of commodity derivative contract, emission allowance contract or derivative contract thereof should not be netted against each other.
