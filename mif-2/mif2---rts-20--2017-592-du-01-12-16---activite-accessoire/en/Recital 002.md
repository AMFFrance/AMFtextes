(2) The assessment should be performed in the form of two tests, which are both based on the trading activity of the persons within the group and should be calculated on a per-asset-class basis. The first test should determine whether the persons within the group are large participants relative to the size of the financial market in that asset class and as a consequence should be required to obtain authorisation as an investment firm. The second test should determine whether the persons within the group trade on own account or provide investment services in commodity derivatives, emission allowances or derivatives thereof to such a large extent relative to the main business of the group that those activities cannot be considered to be ancillary at group level and that therefore the persons should be required to obtain authorisation as an investment firm.
