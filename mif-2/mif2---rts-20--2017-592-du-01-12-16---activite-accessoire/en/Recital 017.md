(17) When a person applying the ancillary activity test uses portfolio or macro hedging, it may not be able to establish a one-to-one link between a specific transaction in a commodity derivative and a specific risk directly related to the commercial and treasury financing activities entered into to hedge it. The risks directly related to the commercial and treasury financing activities may be of a complex nature e.g. several geographic markets, several products, time horizons or entities. The portfolio of commodity derivative contracts entered into to mitigate those risks may derive from complex risk management systems. In such cases the risk management systems should prevent non-hedging transactions from being categorised as hedging and provide for a sufficiently disaggregate view of the hedging portfolio so that speculative components are identified and counted towards the thresholds. Positions should not qualify as reducing risks related to commercial activity solely on the grounds that they form part of a risk-reducing portfolio on an overall basis.
