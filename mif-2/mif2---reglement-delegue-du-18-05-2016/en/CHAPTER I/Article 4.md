# Article 4 - Determining liquid markets for certificates


1.   For the purposes of Article 2(1)(17)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, a certificate that is traded daily shall be considered to have a liquid market where all of the following conditions are satisfied:

(a) the free float is not less than EUR 1 million;

(b) the average daily number of transactions in the certificate is not less than 20;

(c) the average daily turnover for the certificate is not less than EUR 500 000.

2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1(a), the free float of a certificate shall be the issuance size irrespective of the number of units issued.

3.   For the purposes of paragraph 1(c), the daily turnover for the certificate shall be calculated by aggregating the results of multiplying, for each transaction executed during a trading day, the number of units of the certificate exchanged between the buyer and the seller by the price per unit.

4.   During the six-week period commencing on the first trading day following the first admission of a certificate to trading on a trading venue, that certificate shall be considered to have a liquid market for the purposes of Article 2(1)(17)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 where the estimated free float at the start of the first trading day stands at not less than EUR 1 million, and, where, according to estimated data for that period, the conditions set out in paragraph 1(b) and (c) are fulfilled.

5.   Where fewer than five certificates traded on the trading venues of a Member State and first admitted to trading in that Member State are considered to have a liquid market in accordance with paragraph 1, the competent authority of that Member State may designate one or more certificate first admitted to trading on those trading venues as certificate considered to have a liquid market, provided that the total number of certificates first admitted to trading in that Member State and considered to have a liquid market does not exceed five.
