The existence of a ‘threat’, one of the prerequisites of the intervention in the perspective of the orderly functioning and integrity of financial or commodity markets or stability of the financial system, would require the existence of a greater concern than a ‘significant concern’, which is the prerequisite of the intervention for investor protection.
