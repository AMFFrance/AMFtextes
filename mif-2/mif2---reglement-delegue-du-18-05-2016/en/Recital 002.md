(2) The provisions in this Regulation are closely linked, since they deal with definitions and specify requirements in relation to pre- and post-trade transparency by systematic internalisers and data publication by trading venues and systematic internalisers, on the one hand, and the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) product intervention and position management powers, on the other. To ensure coherence between those provisions which should enter into force at the same time, and in order to facilitate a comprehensive view for stakeholders and, in particular, those subject to the obligations, it is necessary to include these provisions in a single Regulation.
