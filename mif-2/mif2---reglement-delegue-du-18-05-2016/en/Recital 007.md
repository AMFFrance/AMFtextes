(7) To allow data users to obtain market data without having to buy other services, market data should be offered unbundled from other services. To avoid data users being charged more than once for the same market data when buying data sets from trading venues and from other market data distributors, market data should be offered on a per user basis unless doing so would be disproportionate considering the cost of such way of offering that data in respect of the scale and the scope of the market data provided by the market operator or the investment firm operating a trading venue or the systematic internaliser.
