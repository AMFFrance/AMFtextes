# Article 9 - Obligations in relation to per user fees


1.   Market operators and investment firms operating a trading venue and systematic internalisers shall charge for the use of market data according to the use made by the individual end-users of the market data (‘per user basis’). Market operators and investment firms operating a trading venue and systematic internalisers shall put arrangements in place to ensure that each individual use of market data is charged only once.

2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, market operators and investment firms operating a trading venue and systematic internalisers may decide not to make market data available on a per user basis where to charge on a per user basis is disproportionate to the cost of making that data available, having regard to the scale and scope of the data.

3.   Market operators and investment firms operating a trading venue and systematic internalisers shall provide grounds for the refusal to make market data available on a per user basis and shall publish those grounds on their webpage.
