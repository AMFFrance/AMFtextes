1.   For the purposes of Article 41(2)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, EBA shall assess the relevance of all factors and criteria listed in paragraph 2, and take into consideration all relevant factors and criteria in determining when the marketing, distribution or sale of certain structured deposits or structured deposits with certain specified features or a type of financial activity or practice creates a significant investor protection concern or a threat to the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or to the stability of the whole or part of the financial system in the Union.

For the purposes of the first subparagraph, EBA may determine the existence of a significant investor protection concern or a threat to the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or to the stability of the whole or part of the financial system of the Union based on one or more of those factors and criteria.

2.   The factors and criteria to be assessed by EBA to determine whether there is a significant investor protection concern or a threat to the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or to the stability of the whole or part of the financial system in the Union shall be the following:

(a) the degree of complexity of a structured deposit or type of financial activity or practice in relation to the type of clients, as assessed in accordance with point (c), involved in the financial activity, or financial practice, taking into account, in particular: — the type of the underlying or reference assets and the degree of transparency of the underlying or reference assets; — the degree of transparency of costs and charges associated with the structured deposit, financial activity or financial practice and, in particular, the lack of transparency resulting from multiple layers of costs and charges; — the complexity of the performance calculation, taking into account in particular whether the return is dependent on the performance of one or more underlying or reference assets which are in turn affected by other factors or whether the return depends not only on the values of the underlying or reference assets at the initial and maturity or interest payment dates, but also on the values during the lifetime of the product; — the nature and scale of any risks; — whether the structured deposit or service is bundled with other products or services; or — the complexity of any terms and conditions;

(j) the selling practices associated with the structured deposit, taking into account, in particular: — the communication and distribution channels used; — the information, marketing or other promotional material associated with the investment; — the assumed investment purposes; or — whether the decision to buy is a secondary or tertiary following an earlier purchase;

(k) the financial and business situation of the issuer of a structured deposit, taking into account, in particular: — the financial situation of the issuer or any guarantor; or — the transparency of the business situation of the issuer or guarantor;
