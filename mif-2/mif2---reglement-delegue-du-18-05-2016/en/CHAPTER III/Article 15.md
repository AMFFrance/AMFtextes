# Article 15 - Orders considerably exceeding the norm


1.   For the purposes of Article 17(2) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, the number or volume of orders shall be considered to considerably exceed the norm where a systematic internaliser cannot execute the number or volume of those orders without exposing itself to undue risk.

2.   Investment firms acting as systematic internalisers shall determine in advance and in a manner that is objective and consistent with their risk management policy and procedures referred to in Article 23 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 (9), when the number or volume of orders sought by clients is considered to expose the firm to undue risk.

3.   For the purposes of paragraph 2, a systematic internaliser shall establish, maintain and implement as part of its risk management policy and procedures, a policy for identifying the number or volume of orders that it can execute without being exposed to undue risk, taking into account both the capital that the firm has available to cover the risk for that type of trade and the prevailing conditions in the market.

4.   In accordance with Article 17(2) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, the policy referred to in paragraph 3 shall be non-discriminatory to clients.
