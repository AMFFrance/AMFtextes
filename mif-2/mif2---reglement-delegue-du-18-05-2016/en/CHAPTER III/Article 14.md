# Article 14 - Execution of orders by systematic internalisers


1.   For the purposes of Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, exceptional market conditions are considered to exist where to impose on a systematic internaliser an obligation to provide firm quotes to clients would be contrary to prudent risk management and, in particular, where:

(a) the trading venue where the financial instrument was first admitted to trading or the most relevant market in terms of liquidity halts trading for that financial instrument in accordance with Article 48(5) of Directive 2014/65/EU;

(b) the trading venue where the financial instrument was first admitted to trading or the most relevant market in terms of liquidity allows market making obligations to be suspended;

(c) in the case of an exchange traded fund, a reliable market price is not available for a significant number of instruments underlying the ETF or the index;

(d) a competent authority prohibits short sales in that financial instrument according to Article 20 of Regulation (EU) No 236/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8).

2.   For the purposes of Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, a systematic internaliser may update its quotes at any time, provided at all times that the updated quotes are the consequence of, and consistent with, genuine intentions of the systematic internaliser to trade with its clients in a non-discriminatory manner.

3.   For the purposes of Article 15(2) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, a price falls within a public range close to market conditions where the following conditions are fulfilled:

(a) the price is within the bid and offer quotes of the systematic internaliser;

(b) the quotes referred to in point (a) reflect prevailing market conditions for the relevant financial instrument in accordance with Article 14(7) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014.

4.   For the purposes of Article 15(3) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, execution in several securities shall be considered part of one transaction where the criteria laid down in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/587 are fulfilled.

5.   For the purposes of Article 15(3) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, an order shall be considered subject to conditions other than the current market price where the criteria laid down in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/587 are fulfilled.
