(1) This Regulation further specifies the criteria for the determination of ‘liquid market’ in accordance with Article 2(1)(17)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014. For this purpose it is necessary to specify the criteria for free float, average daily number of transactions and average daily turnover specifically for shares, depositary receipts, exchange traded funds and certificates to take into account the specificities of each of these financial instruments. Rules specifying how liquidity calculations should be performed during the initial stage after the financial instrument is admitted to trading are required to ensure a consistent and uniform application across the Union.
