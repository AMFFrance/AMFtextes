# Article 20 - Pre-trade and post-trade controls


1.   Trading venues shall carry out the following pre-trade controls adapted for each financial instruments traded on them:

(a) price collars, which automatically block orders that do not meet pre-set price parameters on an order-by-order basis;

(b) maximum order value, which automatically prevents orders with uncommonly large order values from entering the order book by reference to notional values per financial instrument;

(c) maximum order volume, which automatically prevents orders with an uncommonly large order size from entering the order book.

2.   The pre-trade controls laid down in paragraph 1 shall be designed so as to ensure that:

(a) their automated application has the ability to readjust a limit during the trading session and in all its phases;

(b) their monitoring has a delay of no more than five seconds;

(c) an order is rejected once a limit is breached;

(d) procedures and arrangements are in place to authorise orders above the limits upon request from the member concerned. Such procedures and arrangements shall apply in relation to a specific order or set of orders on a temporary basis in exceptional circumstances.

3.   Trading venues may establish the post-trade controls that they deem appropriate on the basis of a risk assessment of their members' activity.
