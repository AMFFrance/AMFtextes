1.   For the purposes of Article 40(2)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, ESMA shall assess the relevance of all factors and criteria listed in paragraph 2, and take into consideration all relevant factors and criteria in determining when the marketing, distribution or sale of certain financial instruments or financial instruments with certain specified features or a type of financial activity or practice creates a significant investor protection concern or a threat to the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or commodity markets or to the stability of the whole or part of the financial system of the Union.

For the purposes of the first subparagraph, ESMA may determine the existence of a significant investor protection concern or a threat to the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or commodity markets or to the stability of the whole or part of the financial system of the Union based on one or more of those factors and criteria.
