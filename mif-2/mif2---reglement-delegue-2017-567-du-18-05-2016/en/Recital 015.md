(15) Since liquidity providers and systematic internalisers both trade on own account and incur comparable levels of risks, it is appropriate to determine the size specific to the instrument in a uniform way for these categories. Therefore, the size specific to the instrument for the purposes of Article 18(6) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 should be the size specific to the instrument determined in accordance with Article 9(5)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and as further specified in regulatory technical standards in accordance with this provision.
