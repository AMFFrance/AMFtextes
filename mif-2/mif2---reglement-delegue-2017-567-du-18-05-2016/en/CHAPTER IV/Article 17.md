# Article 17 - Elements of Portfolio compression


1.   For the purposes of Article 31(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, investment firms and market operators providing portfolio compression shall fulfil the conditions in paragraphs 2 to 6.

2.   Investment firms and market operators shall conclude an agreement with the participants to the portfolio compression providing for the compression process and its legal effects, including identifying the point in time at which each portfolio compression becomes legally binding.

3.   The agreement referred to in paragraph 2 shall include all relevant legal documentation describing how derivatives submitted for inclusion in the portfolio compression are terminated and how they are replaced by other derivatives.

4.   Before each compression process is initiated, investment firms and market operators providing portfolio compression shall:

(a) require each participant to the portfolio compression to specify the participant's risk tolerance including specifying a limit for counterparty risk, a limit for market risk and a cash payment tolerance. Investment firms and market operators shall respect the risk tolerance specified by the participants in the portfolio compression;

(b) link the derivatives submitted for portfolio compression and submit to each participant a portfolio compression proposal that includes the following information: (i) the identification of the counterparties affected by the compression, (ii) the related change to the combined notional value of the derivatives, (iii) the variation of the combined notional amount compared to the risk tolerance specified.

5.   In order to adjust the compression to the risk tolerance set by the participants to the portfolio compression and in order to maximise the efficiency of the portfolio compression, investment firms and market operators may grant participants additional time to add derivatives eligible for termination or reduction.

6.   Investment firms and market operators shall only perform the portfolio compression once all participants to the portfolio compression have agreed to the portfolio compression proposal.
