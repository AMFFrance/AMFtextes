(11) This Regulation further specifies various technical aspects of the scope of the transparency obligations of systematic internalisers in order to ensure a consistent and uniform application across the Union. It is necessary that the exception to systematic internalisers' obligation to make public their quotes on a regular and continuous basis be strictly limited to situations where the continued provision of firm prices to clients may be contrary to the prudent management of the risks the investment firm is exposed to in its capacity as systematic internalisers, having regard to other mechanisms which may provide additional safeguards against such risks.
