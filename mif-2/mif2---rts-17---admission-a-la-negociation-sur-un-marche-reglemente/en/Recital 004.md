(4) The admission to trading on a regulated market of units issued by undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities or alternative investment funds should not allow the avoidance of the relevant provisions of Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) or of Directive 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). Therefore, it is necessary for an operator of a regulated market to verify that the units it admits to trading stem from a collective investment scheme that complies with the relevant sectoral legislation. In the case of exchange-traded funds, it is necessary for the operator of a regulated market to ensure that adequate redemption arrangements for investors are in place at all times.
