Any emission allowance within the meaning of point 11 of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EU recognised for compliance with the requirements of Directive 2003/87/EC should therefore be eligible for admission to trading on a regulated market and no further requirements should be imposed in this Regulation
