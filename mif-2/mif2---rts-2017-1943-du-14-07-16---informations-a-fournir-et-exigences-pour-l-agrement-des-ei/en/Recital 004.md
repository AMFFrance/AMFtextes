(4) Newly established entities, when submitting an application, may only be in a position to provide information on how capital will be raised and the types and amount of capital that will be raised. However, evidence of paid-up share capital and other types of capital raised, together with information on the sources of capital, should be provided to the competent authorities, in view of obtaining authorisation, before authorisation is granted. Such evidence may include copies of relevant capital instruments and corresponding bank statements.
