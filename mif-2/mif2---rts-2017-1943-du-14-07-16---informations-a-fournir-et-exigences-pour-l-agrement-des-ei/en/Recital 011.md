(11) In order to provide legal certainty, clarity and predictability with regards to the authorisation process, it is appropriate that the criteria against which competent authorities appraise the suitability of the shareholders or members with qualifying holdings, when authorising an investment firm, are the same criteria set out by ArticleÂ 13 of Directive 2014/65/EU for the assessment of a proposed acquisition. In particular, competent authorities should appraise the suitability of the shareholders or members with qualifying holdings and the financial soundness of the firm taking into account criteria relating to the reputation, experience of the persons directing the business of the investment firm and the financial soundness of the firm.
