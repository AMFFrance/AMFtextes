(7) The calculation of the ratio of unexecuted orders to transactions entered into the system by a member or participant should be supported by an adequate observation period. On that basis, the calculation period of the effective ratio of unexecuted orders to transactions should not be longer than a trading session. However, trading venues should be allowed to set out shorter observation periods in case such shorter observation periods would contribute more effectively to maintain orderly trading conditions.
