(a) clear lines of accountability, including procedures to approve the development, deployment and subsequent updates of trading algorithms and to solve problems identified when monitoring trading algorithms;

(b) effective procedures for the communication of information within the investment firm, such that instructions can be sought and implemented in an efficient and timely manner;
