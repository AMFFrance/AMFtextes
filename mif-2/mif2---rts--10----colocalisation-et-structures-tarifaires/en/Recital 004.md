(4) Trading venues should have the ability to determine their commercial policy as regards co-location and determine which types of market participants they want to grant access to those services provided that their commercial policy is based on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria. Trading venues should not be required to extend their co-location capacities beyond the limits of the space, power, cooling or similar facilities available and should have discretion to decide whether they expand their co-location space or not.
