(6) The identification of market-making strategies or similar activities is important in order to enable efficient detection of market manipulation. This allows the competent authorities to distinguish the order flow coming from an investment firm acting on the basis of terms pre-determined by the issuer of the instrument which is the subject of the order or by the trading venue to which the order is submitted from the order flow coming from an investment firm acting at its own or at its client's discretion.
