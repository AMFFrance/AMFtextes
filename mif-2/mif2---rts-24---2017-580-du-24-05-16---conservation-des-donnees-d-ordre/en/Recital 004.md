(4) In order to allow competent authorities to more efficiently identify suspicious patterns of potentially abusive behaviour originating from one client, including where the client is operating through a number of investment firms, the operators of trading venues should record the identity of clients on whose behalf their members or participants submitted the order. Operators should identify those clients by unique identifiers in order to facilitate certain and efficient identification of such persons and thereby facilitate more effective analysis of potential market abuse in which clients may be involved.
