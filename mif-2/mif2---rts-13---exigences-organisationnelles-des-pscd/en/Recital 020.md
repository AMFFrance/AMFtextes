(20) This Regulation sets out a number of additional services a CTP could perform which increase the efficiency of the market. In view of possible market developments, it is not appropriate to provide an exhaustive list of additional services which a CTP could perform. A CTP should therefore be able to provide further services going beyond the additional services specifically listed in this Regulation provided however that those other services do not pose any risk to the independence of the CTP or the quality of the consolidated tape.
