(16) APAs and CTPs should be able to delete and amend the information which they receive from an entity providing them with information to deal with situations where in exceptional circumstances the reporting entity is experiencing technical difficulties and cannot delete or amend the information itself. However, APAs and CTPs should not otherwise be responsible for correcting information contained in published reports where the error or omission was attributable to the entity providing the information. This is due to the fact that APAs and CTPs cannot know with certainty whether a perceived error or omission is indeed incorrect since they were not party to the executed trade.
