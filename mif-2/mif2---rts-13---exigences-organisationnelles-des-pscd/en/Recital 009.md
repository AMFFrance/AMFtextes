(9) Where a service disruption occurs, a data reporting services provider should notify the competent authority of its home Member State, any other relevant competent authorities, clients and the public as the disruption could also mean that those parties would not be able to fulfil their own regulatory obligations such as the duty to forward transaction reports to other competent authorities or to make public the details of executed transactions. The notification should allow those parties to make alternative arrangements for meeting their obligations.
