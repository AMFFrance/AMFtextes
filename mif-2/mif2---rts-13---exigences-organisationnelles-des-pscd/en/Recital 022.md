(22) With respect to equity and equity-like instruments, Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 does not exclude that investment firms make public their transactions through more than one APA. However, a specific arrangement should be in place to enable interested parties consolidating the trade information from various APAs, in particular CTPs, to identify such potential duplicate trades as otherwise the same trade might be consolidated several times, and published repeatedly by the CTPs. This would undermine the quality and usefulness of the consolidated tape.
