(4) All members of the management body of a data reporting services provider should be persons who are of sufficiently good repute and possess sufficient knowledge, skills and experience, as those persons play a key role in ensuring that the data reporting services provider meets its regulatory obligations and contribute to the business strategy of the data reporting services provider. It is therefore important for the data reporting services provider to demonstrate that it has a robust process for appointing and evaluating the performance of members of the management body and that clear reporting lines and regular reporting to the management body are in place.
