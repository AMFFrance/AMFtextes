(2) An applicant seeking authorisation as a data reporting services provider should provide in its application for authorisation a programme of operations and an organisational chart. The organisational chart should identify who is responsible for the different activities to enable the competent authority to assess whether the data reporting services provider has sufficient human resources and oversight over its business. The organisational chart should not only cover the scope of the data reporting services, but should also include any other services that the entity provides as this may highlight areas which may affect the independence of the data reporting services provider and give rise to a conflict of interest. An applicant seeking authorisation as a data reporting services provider should also provide information on the composition, functioning and independence of its governing bodies in order for competent authorities to be able to assess whether the policies, procedures and corporate governance structure ensure the independence of the data reporting services provider and the avoidance of conflicts of interest.
