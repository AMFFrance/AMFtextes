(12) Breaches in the physical or electronic security of a data reporting services provider pose a threat to the confidentiality of client data. Consequently, where such a breach occurs, a data reporting services provider should promptly notify the relevant competent authority as well as any clients which have been affected by the breach. Notification to the competent authority of the home Member State is necessary to enable that competent authority to carry out its ongoing supervisory responsibilities with respect to whether the data reporting services provider is properly maintaining sound security mechanisms to guarantee the security of the information and to minimise the risk of data corruption and unauthorised access. Other competent authorities which have a technical interface with the data reporting services provider should also be notified as they may be adversely affected, particularly where the breach relates to the means of transferring information between the data reporting services provider and the competent authority.
