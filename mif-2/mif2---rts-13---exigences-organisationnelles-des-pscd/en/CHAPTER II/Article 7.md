(g) staff training on the operation of the business continuity arrangements, individuals' roles including specific security operations personnel ready to react immediately to a disruption of services;

4.   A data reporting services provider shall set up a programme for periodically testing, reviewing and, where needed, modifying the business continuity arrangements.

5.   A data reporting services provider shall publish on its website and promptly inform the competent authority of its home Member State and its clients of any service interruptions or connection disruptions as well as the time estimated to resume a regular service.

6.   In the case of ARMs, the notifications referred to in paragraph 5 shall also be made to any competent authority to whom the ARM submits transaction reports.
