(19) A data reporting services provider should also ensure that it stores the transaction and trade reporting information which it handles for a sufficiently long period of time in order to facilitate the retrieval of historical information by competent authorities. In the specific case of APAs and CTPs, they should ensure that they establish the necessary organisational arrangements to maintain the data for at least the period specified in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and are able to respond to any request to provide services regulated by this Regulation.
