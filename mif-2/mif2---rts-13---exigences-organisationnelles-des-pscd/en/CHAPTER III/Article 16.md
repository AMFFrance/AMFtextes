# Article 16 - Identification of original and duplicative trade reports in shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates and other similar financial instruments


1.   Where an APA publishes a trade report which is a duplicate, it shall insert the code ‘DUPL’ in a reprint field to enable recipients of the data to differentiate between the original trade report and any duplicates of that report.

2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, an APA shall require each investment firm to comply with one of the following conditions:

(a) to certify that it only reports transactions in a particular financial instrument through that APA;

(b) to use an identification mechanism which flags one report as the original one (‘ORGN’), and all other reports of the same transaction as duplicates (‘DUPL’).
