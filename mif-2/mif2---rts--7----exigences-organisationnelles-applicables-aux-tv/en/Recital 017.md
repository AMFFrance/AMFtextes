(17) Trading venues should specify the requirements to be met by their members in order for them to be allowed to provide DEA and determine the minimum standards to be met by prospective DEA clients in the due diligence process. Those requirements and standards should be adapted to the risks posed by the nature, scale and complexity of their expected trading, and the service being provided. In particular, they should include an assessment of the level of expected trading, the order volume and the type of connection offered.
