(3) The impact of technological development and in particular algorithmic trading is one of the main drivers to determine the capacity and arrangements to manage trading venues. The risks arising from algorithmic trading can be present in any type of trading system that is supported by electronic means. Therefore, specific organisational requirements should be laid down in respect of regulated markets, multilateral trading facilities and organised trading facilities allowing for or enabling algorithmic trading through their systems. Such trading systems are those where algorithmic trading may take place as opposed to trading systems in which algorithmic trading is not permitted, including trading systems where transactions are arranged through voice negotiation.
