(10) In order to carry out the calculations for determining the requirements for the pre-trade and post-trade transparency in accordance with Article 22(1) of Regulation (EU) NoÂ 600/2014, the content, frequency of data requests and the formats and timeframe in which trading venues, APAs and CTPs must respond to such requests in accordance with Article 22(4) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 should be developed. The results of the calculations made on the basis of the data collected according to Article 22(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 need to be published in order to inform market participants of those results and achieve pre- and post-trade transparency in practice. It is also appropriate to provide for the centralised publication of the results of the calculations so that they are made available to all financial market participants and competent authorities in the Union in a single place and in a user-friendly manner. To that end, competent authorities should notify European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) of the results of their calculations and then ESMA should publish those calculations on its website.
