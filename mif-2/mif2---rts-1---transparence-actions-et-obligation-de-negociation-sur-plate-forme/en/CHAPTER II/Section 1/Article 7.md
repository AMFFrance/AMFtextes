# Article 7 - Orders that are large in scale


1.   An order in respect of a share, depositary receipt, certificate or other similar financial instrument shall be considered to be large in scale where the order is equal to or larger than the minimum size of orders set out in Tables 1 and 2 of Annex II.

2.   An order in respect of an ETF shall be considered to be large in scale where the order is equal to or larger than EUR 1 000 000.

3.   For the purpose of determining orders that are large in scale, competent authorities shall calculate, in accordance with paragraph 4, the average daily turnover in respect of shares, depositary receipts, certificates and other similar financial instruments traded on a trading venue.

4.   The calculation referred to in paragraph 3 shall have the following characteristics:

(a) it shall include transactions executed in the Union in respect of the financial instrument, whether traded on or outside a trading venue;

(b) it shall cover the period beginning on 1 January of the preceding calendar year and ending on 31 December of the preceding calendar year or, where applicable, that part of the calendar year during which the financial instrument was admitted to trading or traded on a trading venue and was not suspended from trading.

Paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to shares, depositary receipts, certificates and other similar financial instruments first admitted to trading or first traded on a trading venue four weeks or less before the end of the preceding calendar year.

5.   Unless the price or other relevant conditions for the execution of an order are amended, the waiver referred to in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 shall continue to apply in respect of an order that is large in scale when entered into an order book but that, following partial execution, falls below the threshold applicable for that financial instrument as determined in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2.

6.   Before a share, depositary receipt, certificate or other similar financial instrument is traded for the first time on a trading venue in the Union, the competent authority shall estimate the average daily turnover for that financial instrument taking into account any previous trading history of that financial instrument and of other financial instruments that are considered to have similar characteristics, and ensure publication of that estimate.

7.   The estimated average daily turnover referred to in paragraph 6 shall be used for the calculation of orders that are large in scale during a six-week period following the date that the share, depositary receipt, certificate or other similar financial instrument was admitted to trading or first traded on a trading venue.

8.   The competent authority shall calculate and ensure publication of the average daily turnover based on the first four weeks of trading before the end of the six-week period referred to in paragraph 7.

9.   The average daily turnover referred to in paragraph 8 shall be used for the calculation of orders that are large in scale and until an average daily turnover calculated in accordance with paragraph 3 applies.

10.   For the purposes of this Article, the average daily turnover shall be calculated by dividing the total turnover for a particular financial instrument as specified in Article 17(4) by the number of trading days in the period considered. The number of trading days in the period considered is the number of trading days on the most relevant market in terms of liquidity for that financial instrument as determined in accordance with Article 4.
