(5) It is appropriate to provide for clarification of a limited number of technical terms. Those technical definitions are necessary to ensure the uniform application in the Union of the provisions contained in this Regulation and, hence, contribute to the establishment of a single rulebook for financial markets in the Union. Those definitions are purely functional for the purpose of setting out the transparency obligations for equity and equity-like financial instruments and should be strictly limited to understanding this Regulation.
