(12) Likelihood of execution indicates the probability of execution of a particular type of order and is supported by details on trading volumes in a particular instrument or other characteristics of orders and transactions. Information on likelihood of execution should allow for the calculation of metrics such as the relative market size of a venue in a particular financial instrument or a class of financial instruments. Likelihood of execution should also be assessed with data on failed transactions or cancelled or modified orders.
