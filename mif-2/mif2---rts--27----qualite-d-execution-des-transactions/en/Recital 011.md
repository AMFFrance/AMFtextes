(11) It is essential to have full transparency on all costs charged when executing an order through a given venue. It is necessary to specify all costs in the execution of a client order relevant to the use of a specific venue and for which the client pays directly or indirectly. Those costs should include execution fees, including fees for the submission, modification or cancellation of orders or quotes withdrawals, as well as any fees related to market data access or use of terminals. The relevant costs may also include clearing or settlement fees or any other fees paid to third parties involved in the execution of the order when they are part of the services provided by the execution venue. Information on costs should also include taxes or levies directly invoiced to or incurred by the venue on behalf of the members or users of the execution venue or the client to whom the order refers.
