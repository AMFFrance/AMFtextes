(13) Speed of execution may have different meanings for the different types of execution venues as the measurement of speed varies by both trading systems and trading platform. For continuous auction order books, speed of execution should be expressed in milliseconds while for other trading systems it is appropriate to use larger units of time. It is also appropriate to exclude the latency of a particular participant's connection to the execution venue, as this is outside of the control of the execution venue itself.
