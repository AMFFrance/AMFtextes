(3) Due to the need for speedy and accurate communication enabling the functioning of the exchange of information and of the cooperation set out in Directive 2014/65/EU, uniform formats and timing of the communications and publication allowing all relevant information to be easily and efficiently communicated and published should be provided for. The use of those formats and timing should be without prejudice to using other formats or timing in exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances where the formats and timing laid down in this Regulation would not be appropriate having regard to the large scale and urgency of communications resulting from, for instance, the closure of the entire market.
