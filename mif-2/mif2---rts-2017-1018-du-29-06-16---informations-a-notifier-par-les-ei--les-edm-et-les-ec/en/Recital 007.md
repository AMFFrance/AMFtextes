(7) The provisions in this Regulation are closely linked, since they deal with notifications related to the exercise of the freedom to provide investment services and activities and the exercise of the right of establishment that apply to investment firms, market operators and, where foreseen, credit institutions. To ensure coherence between those provisions, which should enter into force at the same time, and to facilitate a comprehensive view and compact access to them by persons subject to those obligations, it is desirable to include all regulatory technical standards for notification of information required by Title II, Chapter III of Directive 2014/65/EU in a single Regulation.
