(10) The backstop based on a group not exceeding a certain percentage of any of the thresholds set under the first test for each relevant asset class is particularly relevant for very small groups with negligible overall footprint in the relevant commodity derivative trading. On the one hand, those groups may be required to undertake a costly analysis of their trading activities to determine whether that trading reduces risk or not without the result being conclusive on the ancillary nature of the trading activity. On the other hand, those groups are usually not equipped to engage in the capital test as an alternative to the test based on trading. In order to avoid disproportionate burdens on those groups, it is appropriate that groups whose trading activity for each relevant asset class accounts for less than one-fifth of the threshold set under the first test be considered as carrying out that trading as an ancillary activity to their main business. The first method under the second test, however, may not adequately measure the main activity of persons who have significant capital investments, relative to their size, in the creation of infrastructure, transportation and production facilities. Neither does it recognise investments which cannot be hedged in financial markets. Therefore it is necessary for the second test to contain a second method that uses a capital based metric to measure that that trading activity is ancillary to the main business of the group.
