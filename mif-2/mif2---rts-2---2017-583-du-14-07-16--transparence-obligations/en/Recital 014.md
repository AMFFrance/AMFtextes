(14) Exchange for physicals are an integral part of financial markets, allowing market participants to organise and execute exchange-traded derivatives transactions which are linked directly to a transaction in the underlying physical market. They are widely used and they involve a multitude of actors, such as farmers, producers, manufacturers and processors of commodities. Typically an exchange for physical transaction will take place when a seller of a physical asset seeks to close out his corresponding hedging position in a derivative contract with the buyer of the physical asset, when the latter happens to also hold a corresponding hedge in the same derivative contract. They therefore facilitate the efficient closing out of hedging positions which are not necessary anymore.
