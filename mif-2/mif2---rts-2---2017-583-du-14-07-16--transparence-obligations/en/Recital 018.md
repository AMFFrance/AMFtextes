(18) Regulation (EU) NoÂ 600/2014 allows competent authorities to require the publication of supplementary details when publishing information benefitting from a deferral, or to allow deferrals for an extended time period. In order to contribute to the uniform application of these provisions across the Union, it is necessary to frame the conditions and criteria under which supplementary deferrals may be allowed by competent authorities.
