(12) The possibility to specify the application of the obligation of post-trade disclosure of transactions executed between two investment firms, including systematic internalisers, in bonds, structured finance products, emission allowances and derivatives which are determined by factors other than the current market valuation, such as the transfer of financial instruments as collateral, is set out in Regulation (EU) NoÂ 600/2014. Such transactions do not contribute to the price discovery process or risk blurring the picture for investors or hinder best execution and therefore this Regulation specifies the transactions determined by factors other than the current market valuation which should not be made public.
