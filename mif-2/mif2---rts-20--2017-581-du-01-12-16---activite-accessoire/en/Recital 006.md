(6) The second test provides two methods for determining the size of the trading activity in order to compare it to the size of the main activity undertaken by the group. That test takes two forms in order to better reflect the underlying activities of the persons intending to use the exemption whilst minimising the regulatory burden and complexity of implementing the test. The capital test is provided as an alternative to the trading test in order to take into account of the economic reality of the very heterogeneous groups that need to undertake the assessment whether their trading is ancillary to their main business activities, including groups that undertake significant capital investments, relative to their size, in the creation of infrastructure transportation and production facilities, as well as investments which cannot be easily hedged in financial markets. As both forms of the second test cater for the different underlying economic realities of various groups both tests constitute equally suitable methods to determine whether the trading activity is ancillary to the main business of a particular group.
