(14) In order to allow for market participants to plan and operate their business in a reasonable way and to take into account seasonal patterns of activity, the calculation of the tests determining when an activity is considered to be ancillary to the main business should be based on a period of three years. Therefore, entities should perform the assessment whether they breach one of the two thresholds on an annual basis by calculating a simple average of three years on a rolling basis in order to be able to submit their annual notification to the competent authority. This obligation should be without prejudice to the right of the competent authority to request at any time a report from a person about the basis on which that person considers its activity under pointsÂ (i) and (ii) of Article 2(1)(j) of Directive 2014/65/EU to be ancillary to its main business.
