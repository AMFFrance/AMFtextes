(8) This proxy is appropriate because a rational risk-averse entity, such as a producer, processor or consumer of commodities or emission allowances, is deemed to hedge the volume of the commercial activity of its main business with an equivalent volume of commodity derivatives, emission allowances or derivatives thereof. Therefore the volume of all its trading activity in commodity derivatives, emission allowances or derivatives thereof measured in the gross notional value of the underlying is an appropriate proxy for the size of the main business of the group. As groups whose main business activities are not related to commodities or emission allowances would not use commodity or emission allowances derivatives as a risk-reducing tool, their trading in commodity derivatives, emission allowances or derivatives thereof would not qualify as hedging.
