(24) Investment firms' obligations to pass on to clients all fees, commissions or monetary benefits received from third-parties in relation to investment advice on an independent basis or portfolio management services should also be further specified. While firms should pass on inducements as soon as possible, a specific timeframe should not be imposed since third party payments may be received by the investment firm at various points in time and for several clients at once.
