(7) When introducing trading algorithms, an investment firm should ensure controlled deployment of trading algorithms, regardless of whether those trading algorithms are new or previously have been successfully deployed in another trading venue, and whether their architecture has been materially modified. The controlled deployment of trading algorithms should ensure that the trading algorithms perform as expected in a production environment. The investment firm should therefore set cautious limits on the number of financial instruments being traded, the price, value and number of orders, the strategy positions and the number of markets involved and by monitoring the activity of the algorithm more intensively.
