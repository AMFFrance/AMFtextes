(13) An investment firm providing direct electronic access (‘DEA provider’) should remain responsible for the trading carried out through the use of its trading code by its DEA clients. A DEA provider should therefore establish policies and procedures to ensure that trading of its DEA clients complies with the requirements applicable to that provider. That responsibility should constitute the principal factor for establishing pre-trade and post-trade controls and for assessing the suitability of prospective DEA clients. A DEA provider should therefore have sufficient knowledge about the intentions, capabilities, financial resources and trustworthiness of its DEA clients, including, where publicly available, information about the prospective DEA clients' disciplinary history with competent authorities and trading venues.
