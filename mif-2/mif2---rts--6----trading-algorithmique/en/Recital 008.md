(8) Compliance with the specific organisational requirements for an investment firm should be determined according to a self-assessment which includes an assessment of compliance with the criteria set out in Annex I to this Regulation. That self-assessment should furthermore include all other circumstances that may have an impact on the organisation of that investment firm. That self-assessment should be made regularly and should allow the investment firm to gain a full understanding of the trading systems and trading algorithms it uses and the risks stemming from algorithmic trading, irrespective of whether those systems and algorithms were developed by the investment firm itself, purchased from a third party, or designed or developed in close cooperation with a client or a third party.
