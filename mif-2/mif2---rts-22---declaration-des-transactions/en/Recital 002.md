(2) Given market practices, supervisory experience and market developments, the meaning of a transaction for reporting purposes should be broad. It should cover purchases and sales of reportable instruments as well as other cases of acquisition or disposal of reportable instruments, as these may also give rise to market abuse concerns. Furthermore, changes to notional amount may give rise to concerns about possible market abuse as they are similar in nature to additional purchase or sale transactions. In order for competent authorities to distinguish those changes from other purchases or sales, information on those changes should be specifically reported in transaction reports.
