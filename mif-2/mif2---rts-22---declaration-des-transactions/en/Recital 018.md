(18) Determination of the most relevant market in terms of liquidity enables the routing of transaction reports to other competent authorities and enables investors to identify the competent authorities to whom they must report their short positions pursuant to Articles 5, 7 and 8 of Regulation (EU) No 236/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4). The rules for determining the relevant competent authority under Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) have worked effectively for most financial instruments and should therefore remain unchanged. However, new rules should be introduced specifically for those instruments which are not covered by Directive 2004/39/EC, namely for debt instruments issued by a third-country entity, emission allowances and for derivatives for which the immediate underlying has no global identifier, or is a basket or a non-EEA index.
