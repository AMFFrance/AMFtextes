# Article 4 - Denial of access by a CCP based on other factors creating significant undue risks


1.   A CCP may deny an access request on grounds of significant undue risks where any of the following conditions are met:

(a) the CCP does not offer clearing services in respect of the financial instruments for which access is being requested and would not be able with reasonable efforts to launch a clearing service consistent with the requirements set out in Titles II, III and IV of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012;

(b) granting access would threaten the economic viability of the CCP or its ability to meet minimum capital requirements under Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012;

(c) there are legal risks;

(d) there is an incompatibility of CCP rules and trading venue rules that the CCP cannot remedy in cooperation with the trading venue.

2.   A CCP may refuse an access request based on legal risk as referred to in point (c) of paragraph 1, where as a result of granting access, the CCP would not be able to enforce its rules relating to close out netting and default procedures or would not be able to manage the risks arising from the simultaneous use of different trade acceptance models.
