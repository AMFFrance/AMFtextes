# Article 15 - Deferred publication of transactions


1.   Where a competent authority authorises the deferred publication of the details of transactions pursuant to Article 7(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, market operators and investment firms operating a trading venue and investment firms trading outside a trading venue shall make public each transaction no later than at the end of the relevant period set out in Tables 4, 5 and 6 of Annex II provided that the following criteria are satisfied:

(a) the transaction is between an investment firm dealing on own account other than through matched principal trading and another counterparty;

(b) the size of the transaction is equal to or exceeds the relevant minimum qualifying size specified in Tables 4, 5 or 6 of Annex II, as appropriate.

2.   The relevant minimum qualifying size for the purposes of point (b) in paragraph 1 shall be determined in accordance with the average daily turnover calculated as set out in Article 7.

3.   For transactions for which deferred publication is permitted until the end of the trading day as specified in Tables 4, 5 and 6 of Annex II, investment firms trading outside a trading venue and market operators and investment firms operating a trading venue shall make public the details of those transactions either:

(a) as close to real-time as possible after the end of the trading day which includes the closing auction, where applicable, for transactions executed more than two hours before the end of the trading day;

(b) no later than noon local time on the next trading day for transactions not covered in point (a).

For transactions that take place outside a trading venue, references to trading days and closing auctions shall be those of the most relevant market in terms of liquidity as determined in accordance with Article 4.

4.   Where a transaction between two investment firms is executed outside the rules of a trading venue, the competent authority for the purpose of determining the applicable deferral regime shall be the competent authority of the investment firm responsible for making the trade public through an APA in accordance with paragraphs 5 and 6 of Article 12.
