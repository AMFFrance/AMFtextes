(9) The pre-trade and post-trade transparency regime established by Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 should be appropriately calibrated to the market and applied in a uniform manner throughout the Union. In particular, a static determination of the most relevant markets in terms of liquidity, the sizes of orders that are large in scale and standard market sizes would not adequately capture regular modifications of trading patterns affecting equity and equity-like instruments. Therefore, it is essential to lay down the necessary calculations to be performed, including the periods of time to be taken into account when making calculations and the periods of time during which the results of these calculations are applicable, methods of calculation as well as the identification of the competent authority responsible for performing the calculations in accordance with the determination of the relevant competent authority for the purpose of Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as specified in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/571 (3). In this respect, to avoid market distortion effects, the calculation periods should ensure that the relevant thresholds of the regime are updated at appropriate intervals to reflect market conditions. It is also appropriate to provide for the centralised publication of the results of the calculations so that they are made available to all financial market participants and competent authorities in the Union in a single place and in a user-friendly manner. To that end, competent authorities should notify ESMA of the results of their calculations and ESMA should publish those calculations on its website.
