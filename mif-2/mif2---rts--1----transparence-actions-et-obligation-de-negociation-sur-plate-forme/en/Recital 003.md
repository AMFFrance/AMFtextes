(3) The provisions in this Regulation are closely linked since they deal with the transparency requirements applicable to trading venues and investment firms in respect of shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates and other similar financial instruments. To ensure coherence between those provisions, which should enter into force at the same time, and to facilitate a comprehensive view and efficient access for stakeholders, in particular those subject to the obligations, it is appropriate to include them in a single Regulation.
