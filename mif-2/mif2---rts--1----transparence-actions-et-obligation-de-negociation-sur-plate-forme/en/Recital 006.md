(6) Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 brings within the scope of the transparency regime equity-like instruments such as depositary receipts, ETFs and certificates, as well as shares and other equity-like instruments only traded on an MTF. It is necessary, in order to establish a comprehensive and uniform transparency regime, to calibrate the content of the pre-trade information to be made public by trading venues.
