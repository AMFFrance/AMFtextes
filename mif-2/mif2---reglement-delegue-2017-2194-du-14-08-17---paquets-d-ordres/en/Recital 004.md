(4) While it is possible to trade package orders with many different components, liquidity is concentrated in packages consisting exclusively of components from the same asset class, such as interest rate derivatives, equityderivatives, credit derivatives or commodity derivatives. Therefore, package orders composed only of derivatives of one of those asset classes should be eligible for being considered as having a liquid market, whereas package orders composed of derivative components from more than one of those asset classes are not frequently traded and, as a consequence, do not have a liquid market. Furthermore, package orders including components of asset classes other than interest rate derivatives, equity derivatives, credit derivatives or commodity derivatives are not sufficiently standardised and consequently, are not considered as having a liquid market.
