(6) For package orders consisting of interest rate swaps, most transactions are concentrated in package orders where the components have certain benchmark tenors. It is therefore appropriate to consider only those package orders as being liquid as a whole. To reflect the characteristics of the different interest rate swaps, it is important to differentiate contracts starting immediately after the execution of the trade from contracts starting at a predetermined date in the future. The tenor of a contract should be calculated based on the date at which the obligations under the contract come into effect, that is, on the effective date. However, to take into account the liquidity pattern of those contracts as well as to avoid circumvention, those tenors should not be interpreted too strictly, but rather as targeted intervals around a benchmark tenor.
