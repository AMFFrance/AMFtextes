(9) The use of commodity derivatives as a risk-reducing tool however cannot be considered a perfect proxy for all the commercial activity that the person or group conducts as its main business since it may not take into account other investments in fixed assets unrelated to derivative markets. In order to correct the potential mismatch between a group's trading in commodity derivatives and the actual size of its main business with regard, in particular, to small groups the first method of the second test should contain a backstop which recognises that the trading activity undertaken by the persons within the group should also not exceed a certain percentage of any of the thresholds set under the first test for each relevant asset class to be deemed ancillary. The higher the percentage of speculative activity within all trading activity of a group, the lower the threshold set under the first test.
