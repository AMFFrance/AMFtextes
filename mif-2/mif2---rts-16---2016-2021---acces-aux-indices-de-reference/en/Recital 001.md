(1) Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 provides for the non-discriminatory access for clearing and trading between central counterparties (CCPs) and trading venues, including access to licences of and information relating to benchmarks which are used to determine the value of some financial instruments for trading and clearing purposes. Given the variety of benchmarks, the information CCPs and trading venues need for clearing or trading purposes may vary depending on a number of factors, including the relevant financial instrument being traded or cleared and the type of benchmark that the financial instrument references. Therefore, CCPs and trading venues should be allowed to request access to any information, provided it is required for clearing or trading purposes.
