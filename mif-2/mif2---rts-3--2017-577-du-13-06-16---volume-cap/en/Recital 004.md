(4) With the exception of potential ad-hoc data requests and calculations to be performed for the purposes of the volume cap mechanism, trading venues, APAs and CTPs should submit reports on a daily basis. Considering the broad scope of financial instruments covered and the large amount of data to be processed, this daily submission enables competent authorities to more accurately process files of manageable sizes and ensures an efficient and timely management of the data submission, data quality check and data processing. Collecting data on a daily basis also simplifies the data provision obligation on trading venues, APAs and CTPs by alleviating them from the burden of calculating the number of trading days in the cases where that quantitative liquidity criterion is applicable, and of aggregating data for the same financial instrument across different time maturity buckets in the cases where the time to maturity has to be considered. Centralising that calculation also ensures a consistent use of the criteria across financial instruments and trading venues.
