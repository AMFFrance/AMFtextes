(4) There are however, trading models for which increased accuracy might not be relevant or feasible. Voice trading systems or request for quote systems where the response requires human intervention or does not allow algorithmic trading, or systems which are used for concluding negotiated transactions should be subject to different accuracy standards. Trading venues operating those trading systems are not typically susceptible to the high volume of events that can happen within the same second, meaning that it is not necessary to impose a finer granularity to time stamping of those events since it is less likely that there would be multiple events occurring at the same time. In addition, trades on those trading venues may be agreed using manual methods which can take time to agree. In those trading venues there is also an inherent delay between the moment when the trade is executed and the moment when the trade is recorded in the trading system, meaning that applying more stringent accuracy requirements would not necessarily lead to more meaningful and accurate record keeping by the operator of the trading venue, its members or participants.
