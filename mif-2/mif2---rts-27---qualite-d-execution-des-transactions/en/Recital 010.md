(10) To ensure regulatory consistency, it is not appropriate to require trading venues to provide details of transactions that remain, at the time of publication, subject to a deferral of publication in compliance with requirements on post trade transparency. It is appropriate that systematic internalisers, market makers and other liquidity providers be exempt from publishing point-in-time transaction data for any transactions above standard market size or above size specific to the financial instrument in order to avoid those venues becoming subject to undue risk of disclosing commercially sensitive information that might hinder their ability to hedge exposures and provide liquidity. For shares, exchange-traded funds and certificates deemed to be illiquid under Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, the standard market size threshold to be used is the minimum available standard market size for that type of financial instrument. To avoid uncertainty, it is appropriate to clarify that reference to large in scale and size specific to the financial instrument have the same meaning as set out in the post trade transparency requirements.
