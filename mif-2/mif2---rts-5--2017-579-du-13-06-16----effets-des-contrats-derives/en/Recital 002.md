(2) Article 33(3) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 states that the conditions laid down in Articles 28 and 29 of that Regulation are deemed to be fulfilled when at least one of the counterparties is established in a country for which the Commission has adopted an implementing act declaring equivalence in accordance with Article 33(2) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014. The present regulatory technical standards should therefore also apply to contracts where both counterparties are established in a third country whose legal, supervisory and enforcement arrangements have not yet been declared equivalent to the requirements laid down in that Regulation.
