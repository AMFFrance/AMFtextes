(2) The scope and the content of information to be communicated to the home competent authority by investment firms, credit institutions or market operators wishing to provide investment services or activates as well as ancillary activities or arrangements to facilitate access and trading vary according to the purpose and the form of the passport rights. For reasons of clarity it is therefore appropriate to define different types of passport notification for the purposes of this Regulation.
