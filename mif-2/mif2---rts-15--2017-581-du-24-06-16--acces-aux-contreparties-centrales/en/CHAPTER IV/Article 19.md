# Article 19 - Further specifications for the calculation of notional amount


1.   In accordance with Article 36(5) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, a trading venue that does not wish to be bound by Article 36 of that Regulation for a period of thirty months from the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 shall include in its calculation of its annual notional amount all transactions in exchange-traded derivatives concluded in the calendar year preceding the application under its rules.

2.   For the purposes of calculating its annual notional amount in accordance with Article 36(5) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 for the year preceding the year of entry into application, a trading venue shall use actual figures for the period for which they are available.

Where, in respect of the year preceding the year of entry into application of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, a trading venue has available data for less than 12 months, it shall produce an estimated figure for that year using the following three inputs:

(a) actual data for the longest possible period commencing at the beginning of the year preceding the year of entry into application of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, including at least the first eight months;

(b) actual data for the equivalent period during the year before the year referred to in point (a) of this paragraph;

(c) actual data for the entire year before the year referred to in point (a) of this paragraph.

The estimated figure for the annual notional amount shall be calculated by multiplying the inputs referred to in point (a) of the second subparagraph by the inputs referred to in point (c) of the second subparagraph and by dividing them by the inputs referred to in point (b) of the second subparagraph.

3.   Where a trading venue wishes to continue not to be bound by Article 36 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 for a further thirty month period at the end of the first, or any further, 30 month period, it shall include in its calculation of its annual notional amount in accordance with Article 36(5) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 all transactions in exchange-traded derivatives concluded under its rules in each of the first two rolling years of the previous thirty month period.

4.   Where there are acceptable alternatives to calculating the annual notional amount for certain types of instruments, but there are notable differences in the values to which such calculation methods give rise, the calculation which gives the higher value shall be used. In particular for derivatives, such as futures or options, including all types of commodity derivatives which are designated in units, the annual notional amount shall be the full value of the derivative's underlying assets at the relevant price at the time at which the transaction is concluded.
