(5) The terms under which access must be permitted should be reasonable and non-discriminatory so as not to undermine the purpose of non-discriminatory access. Charging fees in a discriminatory way so as to deter access should not be permitted. However, fees could differ for objectively justified reasons, such as where the costs to implement the access arrangements are higher. When granting access CCPs and trading venues incur both one-off costs, such as assessing legal requirements, and ongoing costs. Since the scope of the access request and the associated costs for implementing the access agreement are likely to differ on a case-by-case basis, it is not appropriate to cover the specific allocation of costs between the CCP and the trading venue in this Regulation. However, the allocation of costs is an important element of an access agreement, therefore both parties should specify the coverage of costs in that agreement.
