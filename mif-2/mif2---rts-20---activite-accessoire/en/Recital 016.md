(16) In some circumstances, it may not be possible to hedge a commercial risk by using a directly related commodity derivative contract: a contract with exactly the same underlying and settlement date as the risk being covered. In such case, the person may use proxy hedging through a closely correlated instrument to cover its exposure such as an instrument with a different but very close underlying in terms of economic behaviour. Additionally, macro or portfolio hedging may be used by persons, which enter into commodity derivative contracts to hedge a risk in relation to their overall risks or the overall risks of the group. Those macro, portfolio or proxy hedging commodity derivative contracts may constitute hedging for the purpose of this Regulation.
