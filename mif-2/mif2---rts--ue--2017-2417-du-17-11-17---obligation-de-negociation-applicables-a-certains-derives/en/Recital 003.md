(3) Similarly, liquidity in interest rate derivatives subject to the clearing obligation is concentrated in derivative contracts having certain benchmark tenors. It is therefore appropriate to limit the trading obligation to the derivatives with those benchmark tenors. In order to distinguish derivative contracts starting immediately after the execution of the trade from derivative contracts starting at a predetermined date in the future, the tenor of a contract should be calculated based on the effective date at which the obligations under the contract come into effect. However, to adequately take into account the derivatives' liquidity pattern and to avoid circumvention of the trading obligation, it is important not to make use of benchmark tenors as strict thresholds but rather as points of reference for targeted intervals.
