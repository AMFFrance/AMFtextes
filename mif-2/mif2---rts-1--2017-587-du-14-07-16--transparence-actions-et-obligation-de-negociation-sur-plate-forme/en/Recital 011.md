(11) For ETFs, and contrary to shares, depositary receipts, certificates and other similar financial instruments, the average daily turnover does not appear as an appropriate proxy for the calibration of the large-in-scale thresholds. For these instruments, the measure of actual liquidity is not adequately captured by the average daily turnover since the creation and redemption mechanisms inherent to ETFs allow to access additional and non-displayed liquidity. In order to reduce the risk of circumvention, it is also important that two ETFs on the same underlying have the same large-in-scale thresholds regardless of whether they have similar average daily turnover or not. Therefore, a single large-in-scale threshold for all ETFs should be established which should apply regardless of their underlying or of their liquidity.
