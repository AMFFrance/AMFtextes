(14) Investors need to have reliable and timely information about the level of trading interest in financial instruments. Information on certain types of transactions such as the transfer of financial instruments as collateral would not provide meaningful information to investors in respect of the level of genuine trading interest in a financial instrument. Requiring investment firms to make public those transactions would cause significant operational challenges and costs without improving the price formation process. Therefore, post-trade transparency obligations in respect of transactions executed outside a trading venue should only apply in the case of a purchase or sale of a share, depositary receipt, ETF, certificate or other similar financial instrument. It is essential that certain transactions such as those involving the use of any such instruments for collateral lending or other purposes where the exchange is determined by factors other than the current market valuation should not be published as they do not contribute to the price discovery process and would risk leading to investor confusion and hinder best execution.
