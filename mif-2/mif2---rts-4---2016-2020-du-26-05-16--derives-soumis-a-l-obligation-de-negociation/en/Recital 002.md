(2) Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 sets out that derivatives are considered to be executed on an OTC basis when they are not traded on, or not subject to the rules of, a regulated market, whereas the definition of derivatives executed over-the-counter (OTC) under Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) is narrower, comprising derivatives not traded on, or not subject to the rules of, a regulated market, multilateral trading facility (MTF) or organised trading facility (OTF). ESMA should therefore assess the extent to which trades are executed already on trading venues in a class of derivatives or a relevant subset thereof and compare this to the level of trading not executed on a trading venue. The prevalence of trading outside a trading venue should not, however, automatically establish that a class of derivatives or a relevant subset thereof is not suitable for the trading obligation. ESMA should have regard also to the anticipated impact of the trading obligation considering both the possibility to promote liquidity and market integrity through increased transparency and availability of the financial instruments, as well as the potential negative consequences of such a decision.
