# Article 3 - Denial of access by a CCP based on operational risk and complexity


A CCP may deny an access request on grounds of operational risk and complexity.

Operational risks and complexity shall include any of the following:

(a) incompatibility of CCP and trading venue IT systems impeding the CCP to provide for connectivity between the systems;

(b) lack of human resources with the necessary knowledge, skills and experience to perform the CCP's functions regarding the risk stemming from additional financial instruments where these differ from financial instruments already cleared by the CCP or inability to deploy such human resources.
