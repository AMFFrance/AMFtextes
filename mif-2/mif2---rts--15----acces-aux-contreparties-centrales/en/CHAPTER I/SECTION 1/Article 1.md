# Article 1 - Conditions on the denial of access by a CCP


1.   A CCP shall assess whether granting access would create any of the risks specified in Articles 2, 3 and 4 and may deny access only if, after making all reasonable efforts to manage its risks, the CCP concludes that there are significant undue risks that cannot be managed.

2.   If a CCP denies access, it shall identify which risks specified in Articles 2, 3 and 4 would result from granting access and explain why those risks cannot be managed.
