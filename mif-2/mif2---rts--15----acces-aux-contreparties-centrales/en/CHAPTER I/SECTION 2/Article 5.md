# Article 5 - Conditions on the denial of access by a trading venue


1.   A trading venue shall assess whether granting access would create any of the risks specified in Articles 6 and 7 and may deny access only if, after making all reasonable efforts to manage its risks, the trading venue concludes that there are significant undue risks that cannot be managed.

2.   If a trading venue denies access, it shall identify which risks specified in Articles 6 and 7 would result from granting access and why those risks cannot be managed.
