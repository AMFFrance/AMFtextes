# Article 14 - Cross-margining of correlated contracts cleared by the same CCP


Where a CCP calculates margins with respect to cross-margining of correlated contracts cleared by the same CCP (portfolio margining) in accordance with Article 41 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and Article 27 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 153/2013 (6), the CCP shall apply its portfolio margining approach to all relevant correlated contracts irrespective of where the contracts are traded. Contracts with a significant and reliable correlation, or an equivalent statistical parameter of dependence, shall benefit from the same offsets or reductions.
