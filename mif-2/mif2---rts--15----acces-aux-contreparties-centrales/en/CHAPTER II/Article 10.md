# Article 10 - Non-discriminatory and transparent clearing fees charged by CCPs


1.   A CCP shall only charge fees for clearing transactions executed on a trading venue to which it has granted access on the basis of objective criteria, applicable to all clearing members and, where relevant, clients. For this purpose, a CCP shall make all clearing members and, where relevant, clients subject to the same schedule of fees and rebates and its fees shall not depend on the trading venue where the transaction takes place.

2.   A CCP shall only charge fees to a trading venue in relation to access on the basis of objective criteria. For this purpose, the same fees and rebates shall apply to all trading venues accessing the CCP with regard to the same or similar financial instruments, unless a different fee schedule can be objectively justified.

3.   In accordance with Article 38 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 a CCP shall ensure that the fee schedules referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article are easily accessible, adequately identified per service provided and sufficiently granular in order to ensure that fees charged are predictable.

4.   Paragraphs 1 to 3 shall apply to fees charged to cover one-off and ongoing costs.
