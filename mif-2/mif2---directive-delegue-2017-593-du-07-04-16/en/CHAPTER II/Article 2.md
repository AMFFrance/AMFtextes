# Article 2 - Safeguarding of client financial instruments and funds


1.   Member States shall require that investment firms comply with the following requirements:

(a) they must keep records and accounts enabling them at any time and without delay to distinguish assets held for one client from assets held for any other client and from their own assets;

(b) they must maintain their records and accounts in a way that ensures their accuracy, and in particular their correspondence to the financial instruments and funds held for clients and that they may be used as an audit trail;

(c) they must conduct, on a regular basis, reconciliations between their internal accounts and records and those of any third parties by whom those assets are held;

(d) they must take the necessary steps to ensure that any client financial instruments deposited with a third party, in accordance with Article 3, are identifiable separately from the financial instruments belonging to the investment firm and from financial instruments belonging to that third party, by means of differently titled accounts on the books of the third party or other equivalent measures that achieve the same level of protection;

(e) they must take the necessary steps to ensure that client funds deposited, in accordance with Article 4, in a central bank, a credit institution or a bank authorised in a third country or a qualifying money market fund are held in an account or accounts identified separately from any accounts used to hold funds belonging to the investment firm;

(f) they must introduce adequate organisational arrangements to minimise the risk of the loss or diminution of client assets, or of rights in connection with those assets, as a result of misuse of the assets, fraud, poor administration, inadequate record-keeping or negligence.

2.   If, for reasons of the applicable law, including in particular the law relating to property or insolvency, investment firms cannot comply with paragraph 1 of this Article to safeguard clients' rights to satisfy the requirements of Article 16(8) and (9) of Directive 2014/65/EU, Member States shall require that investment firms put in place arrangements to ensure that clients' assets are safeguarded to meet the objectives of paragraph 1 of this Article.

3.   If the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the client funds or financial instruments are held prevents investment firms from complying with points (d) or (e) of paragraph 1, Member States shall prescribe requirements which have an equivalent effect in terms of safeguarding clients' rights.

When relying on such equivalent requirements under Article 2(1)(d) or (e), Member States shall ensure that investment firms inform clients that in such instances they do not benefit from the provisions envisaged under Directive 2014/65/EU and this Directive.

4.   Member States shall ensure that security interests, liens or rights of set-off over client financial instruments or funds enabling a third party to dispose of client's financial instruments or funds in order to recover debts that do not relate to the client or provision of services to the client are not permitted except where this is required by applicable law in a third country jurisdiction in which the client funds or financial instruments are held

Member States shall require investment firms, where the firm is obliged to enter into agreements that create such security interests, liens or rights of set-off, to disclose that information to clients indicating to them the risks associated with those arrangements.

Where security interests, liens or rights of set-off are granted by the firm over client financial instruments or funds, or where the firm has been informed that they are granted, they shall be recorded in client contracts and the firm's own accounts to make the ownership status of client assets clear, such as in the event of an insolvency.

5.   Member States shall require that investment firms make information pertaining to clients' financial instruments and funds readily available to the following entities: competent authorities, appointed insolvency practitioners and those responsible for the resolution of failed institutions. The information to be made available shall include the following:

(a) related internal accounts and records that readily identify the balances of funds and financial instruments held for each client;

(b) where client funds are held by investment firms in accordance with Article 4, details on the accounts in which client funds are held and on the relevant agreements with those firms;

(c) where financial instruments are held by investment firms in accordance with Article 3, details on the accounts opened with third parties and on the relevant agreements with those third parties, as well as details on the relevant agreements with those investment firms;

(d) details of third parties carrying out any related (outsourced) tasks and details of any outsourced tasks

(e) key individuals of the firm involved in related processes, including those responsible for oversight of the firm's requirements in relation to the safeguarding of client assets; and

(f) agreements relevant to establish client ownership over assets.
