# Article 7 - Governance arrangements concerning the safeguarding of client assets


Member States shall ensure that investment firms appoint a single officer of sufficient skill and authority with specific responsibility for matters relating to the compliance by firms with their obligations regarding the safeguarding of client financial instruments and funds.

Member States shall allow investment firms to decide, ensuring full compliance with this Directive, whether the appointed officer is to be dedicated solely to this task or whether the officer can discharge responsibilities effectively whilst having additional responsibilities.
