# Article 11 - Non-discriminatory and transparent fees charged by trading venues


1.   A trading venue shall only charge fees in relation to access on the basis of objective criteria. For this purpose, the same schedule of fees and rebates shall apply to all CCPs accessing the trading venue with regard to the same or similar financial instruments, unless a different fee schedule can be objectively justified.

2.   A trading venue shall ensure that the fee schedules referred to in paragraph 1 are easily accessible, that the fees are adequately identified per service provided and sufficiently granular in order to ensure that the arising fees are predictable.

3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply to all fees related to access, including those that are charged to cover one-off and ongoing costs.
