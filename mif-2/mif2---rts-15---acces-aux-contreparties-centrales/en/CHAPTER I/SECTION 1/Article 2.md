# Article 2 - Denial of access by a CCP based on the anticipated volume of transactions


A CCP may deny an access request on grounds of the anticipated volume of transactions arising from such access only where this would result in one of the following:

(a) the scalable design of the CCP being exceeded to such an extent that the CCP cannot adapt its systems so as to deal with the anticipated volume of transactions;

(b) the planned capacity of the CCP being exceeded in a way that the CCP would not be able to acquire the required extra capacity to clear the anticipated volume of transactions.
