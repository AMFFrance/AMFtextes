(82) In order to improve transparency for clients on the associated costs of their investments and the performance of their investments against the relevant costs and charges over time, periodic ex-post disclosure should also be provided where the investment firms have or have had an ongoing relationship with the client during the year. Ex-post disclosure on all the relevant costs and charges should be provided on a personalised basis. The ex-post periodic disclosure may be made by building on existing reporting obligations, such as obligations for firms providing execution of orders other than portfolio management, portfolio management or holding client financial instruments or funds.
