Examples are the management fees (in table 1, this refers to management fees charged by an investment firm providing the service of portfolio management to its clients while in Table 2 it refers to management fees charged by an investment fund manager to its investor) and broker commissions (in Table 1, they refer to commissions incurred by the investment firm when trading on behalf of its clients while in Table 2 they refer to commissions paid by investment funds when trading on behalf of the fund).

(2)  Switching costs should be understood as costs (if any) that are incurred by investors by switching from one investment firm to another investment firm.

(3)  Broker commissions should be understood as costs that are charged by investment firms for the execution of orders.

(4)  Structuring fees should be understood as fees charged by manufacturers of structured investment products for structuring the products. They may cover a broader range of services provided by the manufacturer.
