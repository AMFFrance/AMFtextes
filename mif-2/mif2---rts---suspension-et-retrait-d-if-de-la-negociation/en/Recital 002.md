(2) In determining cases where the connection is such that it is necessary to suspend or remove related derivatives, the strength of the connection between the derivative and the financial instrument that is suspended or removed from trading should be considered. In this respect, a distinction should be made between a derivative for which the formation of its price or value is dependent on the price or value of a sole underlying financial instrument, and derivatives for which the price or value is dependent on multiple price inputs, for instance, derivatives related to an index or a basket of financial instruments.
