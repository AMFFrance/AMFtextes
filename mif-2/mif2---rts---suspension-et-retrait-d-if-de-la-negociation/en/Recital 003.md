(3) The inability to correctly price related derivatives, leading to a disorderly market, should be considered the strongest for the cases where the derivative is related or referenced to only one financial instrument. When the derivative is related or referenced to a basket of financial instruments or an index of which the suspended financial instrument is only one part, the ability of market participants to determine the correct price would be less affected. Thus the characteristics of the connection between the derivative and the underlying should be taken into account in considering the overall objective of the suspension or removal.
