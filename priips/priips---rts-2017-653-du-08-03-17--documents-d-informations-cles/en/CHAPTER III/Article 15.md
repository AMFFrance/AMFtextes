# Article 15 - Review


1.   PRIIP manufacturers shall review the information contained in the key information document every time there is a change that significantly affects or is likely to significantly affect the information contained in the key information document and, at least, every 12 months following the date of the initial publication of the key information document.

2.   The review referred to in paragraph 1 shall verify whether the information contained in the key information document remains accurate, fair, clear, and non-misleading. In particular, it shall verify the following:

(a) whether the information contained in the key information document is compliant with the general form and content requirements under Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, or with the specific form and content requirements laid down in this Delegated Regulation;

(b) whether the PRIIP's market risk or credit risk measures have changed, where such a change has the combined effect that necessitates the PRIIP's move to a different class of the summary risk indicator from that attributed in the key information document subject to review;

(c) whether the mean return for the PRIIP's moderate performance scenario, expressed as an annualised percentage return, has changed by more than five percentage points.

3.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, PRIIP manufacturers shall establish and maintain adequate processes throughout the life of the PRIIP where it remains available to retail investors to identify without undue delay any circumstances which might result in a change that affects or is likely to affect the accuracy, fairness or clarity of the information contained in the key information document.
