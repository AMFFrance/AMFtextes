# ANNEX VII

## PRESENTATION OF COSTS

The Reduction in Yield (RIY) shows what impact the total costs you pay will have on the investment return you might get. The total costs take into account one-off, ongoing and incidental costs.

The amounts shown here are the cumulative costs of the product itself, for three different holding periods. They include potential early exit penalties. The figures assume you invest [EUR 10 000 (OR EUR 1 000 each year for regular premium PRIIPs)]. The figures are estimates and may change in the future.

## Table 1

## Cost over time

The person selling you or advising you about this product may charge you other costs. If so, this person will provide you with information about these costs, and show you the impact that all costs will have on your investment over time.



## Table 2

## Composition of costs

The table below shows:

— the impact each year of the different types of costs on the investment return you might get at the end of the recommended holding period;

— the meaning of the different cost categories.



For PRIIPs offering a range of options for investment, PRIIP manufacturers shall use the table 1 and table 2 of this Annex for the presentation of the costs, showing for each of the figures in each table, as relevant, the range of the costs.
