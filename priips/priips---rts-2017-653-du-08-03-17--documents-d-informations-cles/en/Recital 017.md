(17) A key information document for a PRIIP that offers many underlying investment options cannot be provided in the same format as a key information document for another PRIIP, since each underlying investment option will have a specific risk, performance and cost profile, which prevents all necessary information to be provided in a single, concise stand-alone document. The underlying investment options may be investments in PRIIPs or other investments of a similar nature, or standardised portfolios of underlying investments. Those underlying investment options can have different risks, rewards and costs. Depending on the nature and number of underlying investment options, the PRIIP manufacturer should therefore, if he deems it appropriate, be able to prepare individual key information documents for each option. Those key information documents should also contain generic information about the PRIIP.
