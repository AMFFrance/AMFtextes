(19) PRIIP manufacturers must prepare key information documents that are accurate, fair, clear and not misleading. The information contained in the document should be capable of being relied on by a retail investor when making an investment decision, even in the months and years following the initial preparation of the key information document, for those PRIIPs that remain available to retail investors. Standards should therefore be laid down to ensure timely and appropriate review and revision of key information documents, so that those documents remain accurate, fair and clear.
