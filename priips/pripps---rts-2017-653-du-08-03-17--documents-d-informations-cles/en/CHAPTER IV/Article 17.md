# Article 17 - Conditions on good time


1.   The person advising on or selling a PRIIP shall provide the key information document sufficiently early so as to allow retail investors enough time to consider the document before being bound by any contract or offer relating to that PRIIP, regardless of whether or not the retail investor is provided with a cooling off period.

2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, the person advising on or selling a PRIIP shall assess the time needed by each retail investor to consider the key information document, taking into account the following:

(a) the knowledge and experience of the retail investor with the PRIIP or with PRIIPs of a similar nature or with risks similar to those arising from the PRIIP;

(b) the complexity of the PRIIP;

(c) where the advice or sale is at the initiative of the retail investor, the urgency explicitly expressed by the retail investor of concluding the proposed contract or offer.
