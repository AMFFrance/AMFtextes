(14) Retail investors may experience a change in personal circumstances where longer term investments unexpectedly need to be disinvested. Disinvestments due to market developments may also be necessary. Given the difficulties for retail investors to anticipate the degree of liquidity they may need in their investment portfolios as a whole, information on recommended holding periods and required minimum holding periods, and the possibility of partial or complete early exit, is particularly important and should be included in the key information document. For the same reasons, the availability and consequences of such early disinvestment should be made clear. Specifically, it should be clear whether such consequences are due to explicit fees, penalties or limitations on disinvestment rights, or to the fact that the value of the particular PRIIP to be disinvested is particularly sensitive to the timing of the disinvestment.
