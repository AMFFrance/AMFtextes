(7) Currently, ratings of External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) provide a consistent proxy for credit risk across different Union sectors. The reliance on credit ratings is, however, to be reduced wherever possible. Therefore, it is important that the summary risk indicator is objectively accurate and ensures comparability between different PRIIPs and that it is appropriately monitored with regard to market risk and credit risk, so that evidence on the effectiveness of the risk measurement in practice can be made available for the review of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 foreseen by 31Â December 2018. The review should take into account the extent to which ECAI ratings in practice reflect the creditworthiness of the PRIIP manufacturer and credit risk faced by investors in individual PRIIPs.
