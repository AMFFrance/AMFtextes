(16) Some retail investors may wish to obtain further information on specific aspects of the PRIIP. The key information document should therefore include a clear and specific cross-reference to where further specific information can be found, where such information is to be included in the key information document pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014. Where the PRIIP manufacturer is obliged to disclose certain other information according to national or Union law, the retail investor should be informed of this fact and of how to obtain those other documents, even if they are only to be provided on request. In view of ensuring that the key information document is as concise as possible, links to those other documents may be provided by means of a website, as long as their existence is made clear and they can be accessed by means of that website.
