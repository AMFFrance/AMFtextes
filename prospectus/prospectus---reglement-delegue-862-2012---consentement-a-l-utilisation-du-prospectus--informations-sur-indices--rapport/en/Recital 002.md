(2) Directive 2003/71/EC was amended by Directive 2010/73/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 amending Directives 2003/71/EC on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading and 2004/109/EC on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market (3) in order to enhance investor protection, reduce administrative burdens for companies when raising capital in the securities markets in the Union and increase efficiency in the prospectus regime. Regulation (EC) No 809/2004 should therefore be amended regarding the consent of the issuer or the person responsible for drawing up the prospectus to the use of the prospectus by financial intermediaries and the information to be included in the prospectus relating to underlying indexes and profit forecasts and estimates.
