(5) With a view to increasing efficiency and reducing administrative burdens, this Regulation should also lay down conditions under which a description of the index within the prospectus is not required when the index is composed by entities acting in association with or on behalf of the issuer. Moreover, as item 2.10 of Annex XV only refers to broadly based and recognised published index, a statement in the prospectus specifying where the information about the index can be found should be sufficient without a description of the composition of the index being necessary.
