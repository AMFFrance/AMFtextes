(2) The process of prospectus review and approval is an iterative one, where the decision of the national competent authority to approve the prospectus involves repeated rounds of analysis and development of the draft prospectus on the part of the issuer, offerer or person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market to ensure that the prospectus meets the requirement of completeness, including the consistency of the information given and its comprehensibility. In order to provide greater certainty about the approval process to issuers, offerers or persons asking for admission to trading, it is necessary to specify which documents should be provided to national competent authorities at different moments in the prospectus approval cycle.
