(4) With the exception of the first draft prospectus, it is imperative that each draft of the prospectus submitted to the national competent authority clearly show changes made to the previously submitted draft and explain how such changes address any incompleteness notified by the national competent authority. Each submission of a draft prospectus to the national competent authority should include both a marked version, highlighting all changes to the previously submitted draft, and an unmarked version, where such changes are not highlighted.
