(9) As the prospectus is the authoritative source of information about an offer to the public or an admission to trading, all information circulated about such offers and admissions to trading, whether for advertising or other purposes and whether in oral or written form, should be consistent with the information contained in the prospectus. This should be ensured by requiring that any information circulated does not contradict, or refer to information which contradicts, the contents of the prospectus. Moreover, the information circulated should be prohibited from presenting a materially unbalanced view of the information contained in the prospectus. Furthermore, as alternative performance measures can disproportionally influence the investment decision, information about an offer to the public or an admission to trading circulated outside the prospectus should not be permitted to contain such measures, if they are not contained in the prospectus.
