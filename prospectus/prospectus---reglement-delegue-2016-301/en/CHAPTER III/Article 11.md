# Article 11 - Dissemination of advertisements


1.   Where an advertisement relating to an offer to the public or an admission to trading on a regulated market has been disseminated, and a supplement to the prospectus is subsequently published, due to the arising or noting of a significant new factor, material mistake or inaccuracy relating to the information included in the prospectus, an amended advertisement shall be disseminated if the significant new factor, material mistake or inaccuracy relating to the information included in the prospectus renders the contents of the previously disseminated advertisement inaccurate or misleading.

2.   An amended advertisement shall make reference to the previous advertisement, specifying that the previous advertisement has been amended due to it containing inaccurate or misleading information and specifying the differences between the two versions of the advertisement.

3.   An amended advertisement shall be disseminated without undue delay following the publication of the supplement. With the exception of orally disseminated advertisements, an amended advertisement shall be disseminated, at a minimum, through the same means as the original advertisement.

The obligation to amend an advertisement shall not apply after the final closing of the offer to the public or after the time when trading on a regulated market begins, whichever occurs later.

4.   Where no prospectus is required in accordance with Directive 2003/71/EC, any advertisement shall include a warning to that effect unless the issuer, offerer or person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market chooses to publish a prospectus which complies with Directive 2003/71/EC, Regulation (EC) No 809/2004 and this Regulation.
