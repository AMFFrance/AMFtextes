# Article 3 - Changes to the draft prospectus


1.   Following submission of the first draft of the prospectus to the competent authority of the home Member State, where the issuer, offerer or person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market submits subsequent drafts of the prospectus, the subsequent drafts shall be marked to highlight all changes made to the preceding unmarked draft of the prospectus as submitted to the competent authority. Where only limited changes are made, marked extracts of the draft prospectus, showing all changes from the preceding draft, shall be considered acceptable. An unmarked draft of the prospectus shall always be submitted along with the draft highlighting all changes.

Where the issuer, offerer or person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market is unable to comply with the requirement set out in the first subparagraph due to technical difficulties related to the marking of the prospectus, each change made to the preceding draft of the prospectus shall be identified to the competent authority of the home Member State in writing.

2.   Where the competent authority of the home Member State has, in accordance with Article 5(2) of this Regulation, notified the issuer, offerer or person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market that it considers that the draft prospectus does not meet the requirement of completeness, including consistency of the information given and its comprehensibility, the subsequently submitted draft of the prospectus shall be accompanied by an explanation as to how the incompleteness notified by the competent authority has been addressed.

Where changes made to a previously submitted draft prospectus are self–explanatory or clearly address the incompleteness notified by the competent authority, an indication of where the changes have been made to address the incompleteness shall be considered sufficient.
