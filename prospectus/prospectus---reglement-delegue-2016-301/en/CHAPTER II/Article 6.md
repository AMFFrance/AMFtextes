# Article 6 - Publication of the prospectus in electronic form


1.   When published in electronic form pursuant to points (c), (d) or (e) of Article 14(2) of Directive 2003/71/EC, the prospectus, whether a single document or comprising several documents, shall:

3.   If a prospectus for offer of securities to the public is made available on the websites of issuers or financial intermediaries or of regulated markets, these shall take measures to avoid targeting residents in Member States or third countries where the offer of securities to the public does not take place, such as the insertion of a disclaimer as to who are the addressees of the offer.

4.   Access to the prospectus published in electronic form shall not be subject to:

(a) completion of a registration process;

(b) acceptance of a disclaimer limiting legal liability;

(c) payment of a fee.
