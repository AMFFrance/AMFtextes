(13) As required by Article 7(2)(e) of Directive 2003/71/EC, a proportionate disclosure regime should adequately take into account the size of issuers, in particular credit institutions issuing non-equity securities referred to in Article 1(2)(j) of Directive 2003/71/EC, which chose to opt into the regime of Directive 2003/71/EC, small and medium-sized enterprises and companies with reduced market capitalisation. However, such issuers should be allowed to choose between schedules with proportionate requirements and the full disclosure regime.
