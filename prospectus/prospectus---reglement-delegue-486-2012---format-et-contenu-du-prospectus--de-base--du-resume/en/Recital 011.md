(11) A summary should be a self-contained part of the prospectus. Where an issuer, an offeror or a person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market is not under an obligation to include a summary in a prospectus but wishes to produce an overview section in the prospectus, this section should not be entitled ‘Summary’ unless the overview section complies with all the disclosure requirements for summaries. Summaries should be drafted in plain language, presenting the information in an easily accessible way.
