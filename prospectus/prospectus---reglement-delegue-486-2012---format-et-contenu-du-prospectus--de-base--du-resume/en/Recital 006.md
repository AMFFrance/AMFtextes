(6) It should be provided that the base prospectus may contain options in relation to all information required for the relevant securities note schedules and building blocks. Final terms should then state which of those options are applicable to the individual issue by referring to the relevant sections of the base prospectus or by reproducing such information. It should be allowed to include certain additional information which does not relate to the securities note in the final terms, if it is considered useful for the investors. That additional information should be specified in this Regulation.
