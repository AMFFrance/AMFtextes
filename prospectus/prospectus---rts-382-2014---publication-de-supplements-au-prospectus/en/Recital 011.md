(11) There are situations where, after the approval of a prospectus, an issuer or offeror decides to offer the securities in Member States other than those referred to in the prospectus, or to apply for admission to trading of the securities on regulated markets in additional Member States other than those provided for in the prospectus. Information about those offers in other Member States or admission to trading on regulated markets therein is important for the investor's assessment of certain aspects of the issuer's securities and therefore would necessitate a supplement.
