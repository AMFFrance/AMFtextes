(6) Where debt securities are convertible or exchangeable into shares which are or will be issued by the issuer of the security or by an entity belonging to its group and these underlying shares are not already admitted to trading on a regulated market, investors should also be provided with a working capital statement and a statement of capitalisation and indebtedness of the issuer of the underlying shares. Those statements would provide investors in the securities note with the same information on the ability of the issuer of the underlying shares to continue as a going concern and on its indebtedness compared to its capitalisation as would be available when investing in shares directly.
