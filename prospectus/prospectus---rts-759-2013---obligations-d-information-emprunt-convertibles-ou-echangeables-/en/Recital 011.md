(11) Convertible or exchangeable debt securities can provide access to issuer’s new shares when the right to subscribe is exercised by their holders. Accordingly, rights issues of convertible or exchangeable debt securities into issuer’s new shares should also be able to benefit from the proportionate disclosure regime set out in Article 26a of Regulation (EC) No 809/2004 provided that the underlying shares are new shares issued by the same entity issuing debt securities. The prospectus for the offer or admission to trading on a regulated market of debt securities convertible or exchangeable into issuer’s shares issued by small and medium sized enterprises and companies with reduced market capitalisation should also benefit from the proportionate disclosure regime set out in Article 26b of Regulation (EC) No 809/2004. Accordingly, the combination of schedules and building blocks applicable to rights issues of debt securities convertible or exchangeable into issuer’s shares or to convertible or exchangeable debt securities issued by small and medium sized enterprises and companies with reduced market capitalisation should be included in Annex XVIII.
