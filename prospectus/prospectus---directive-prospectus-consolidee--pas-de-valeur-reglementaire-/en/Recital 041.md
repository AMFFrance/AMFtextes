(41) In exercising its implementing powers in accordance with this Directive, the Commission should respect the following principles: — the need to ensure confidence in financial markets among small investors and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by promoting high standards of transparency in financial markets, — the need to provide investors with a wide range of competing investment opportunities and a level of disclosure and protection tailored to their circumstances, — the need to ensure that independent regulatory authorities enforce the rules consistently, especially as regards the fight against white-collar crime, — the need for a high level of transparency and consultation with all market participants and with the European Parliament and the Council, — the need to encourage innovation in financial markets if they are to be dynamic and efficient, — the need to ensure systemic stability of the financial system by close and reactive monitoring of financial innovation, — the importance of reducing the cost of, and increasing access to, capital, — the need to balance, on a long-term basis, the costs and benefits to market participants (including SMEs and small investors) of any implementing measures, — the need to foster the international competitiveness of the Community's financial markets without prejudice to a much-needed extension of international cooperation, — the need to achieve a level playing field for all market participants by establishing Community legislation every time it is appropriate, — the need to respect differences in national financial markets where these do not unduly impinge on the coherence of the single market, — the need to ensure coherence with other Community legislation in this area, as imbalances in information and a lack of transparency may jeopardise the operation of the markets and above all harm consumers and small investors.
