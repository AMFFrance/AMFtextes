# Article 4 - Exemptions from the obligation to publish a prospectus


1.  The obligation to publish a prospectus shall not apply to offers of securities to the public of the following types of securities:

(a) shares issued in substitution for shares of the same class already issued, if the issuing of such new shares does not involve any increase in the issued capital;

(b) securities offered in connection with a takeover by means of an exchange offer, provided that a document is available containing information which is regarded by the competent authority as being equivalent to that of the prospectus, taking into account the requirements of Community legislation;

?M2

(c) securities offered, allotted or to be allotted in connection with a merger or division, provided that a document is available containing information which is regarded by the competent authority as being equivalent to that of the prospectus, taking into account the requirements of Union legislation;

(d) dividends paid out to existing shareholders in the form of shares of the same class as the shares in respect of which such dividends are paid, provided that a document is made available containing information on the number and nature of the shares and the reasons for and details of the offer;

(e) securities offered, allotted or to be allotted to existing or former directors or employees by their employer or by an affiliated undertaking provided that the company has its head office or registered office in the Union and provided that a document is made available containing information on the number and nature of the securities and the reasons for and details of the offer.

?M2

Point (e) shall also apply to a company established outside the Union whose securities are admitted to trading either on a regulated market or on a third-country market. In the latter case, the exemption shall apply provided that adequate information, including the document referred to in point (e), is available at least in a language customary in the sphere of international finance and provided that the Commission has adopted an equivalence decision regarding the third-country market concerned.

On the request of the competent authority of a Member State, the Commission shall adopt equivalence decisions in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2), stating whether the legal and supervisory framework of a third country ensures that a regulated market authorised in that third country complies with legally binding requirements which are, for the purpose of the application of the exemption under point (e), equivalent to the requirements resulting from Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on insider dealing and market manipulation (market abuse) ( 17 ), from Title III of Directive 2004/39/EC and from Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2004 on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market ( 18 ), and which are subject to effective supervision and enforcement in that third country. That competent authority shall indicate why it considers that the legal and supervisory framework of the third country concerned is to be considered equivalent and shall provide relevant information to this end.

Such a third-country legal and supervisory framework may be considered equivalent where that framework fulfils at least the following conditions:

(i) the markets are subject to authorisation and to effective supervision and enforcement on an ongoing basis;

(ii) the markets have clear and transparent rules regarding admission of securities to trading so that such securities are capable of being traded in a fair, orderly and efficient manner, and are freely negotiable;

(iii) security issuers are subject to periodic and ongoing information requirements ensuring a high level of investor protection; and

(iv) market transparency and integrity are ensured by the prevention of market abuse in the form of insider dealing and market manipulation.

As regards point (e), in order to take into account the developments of financial markets, the Commission may adopt by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 24a, and subject to the conditions of Articles 24b and 24c, measures to specify the above criteria or to add further ones to be applied in the assessment of the equivalence.

(b) shares issued in substitution for shares of the same class already admitted to trading on the same regulated market, if the issuing of such shares does not involve any increase in the issued capital;

(f) securities offered, allotted or to be allotted to existing or former directors or employees by their employer or an affiliated undertaking, provided that the said securities are of the same class as the securities already admitted to trading on the same regulated market and that a document is made available containing information on the number and nature of the securities and the reasons for and detail of the offer;

(g) shares resulting from the conversion or exchange of other securities or from the exercise of the rights conferred by other securities, provided that the said shares are of the same class as the shares already admitted to trading on the same regulated market;

(h) securities already admitted to trading on another regulated market, on the following conditions: (i) that these securities, or securities of the same class, have been admitted to trading on that other regulated market for more than 18 months; (ii) that, for securities first admitted to trading on a regulated market after the date of entry into force of this Directive, the admission to trading on that other regulated market was associated with an approved prospectus made available to the public in conformity with Article 14; (iii) that, except where (ii) applies, for securities first admitted to listing after 30 June 1983, listing particulars were approved in accordance with the requirements of Directive 80/390/EEC or Directive 2001/34/EC; (iv) that the ongoing obligations for trading on that other regulated market have been fulfilled; (v) that the person seeking the admission of a security to trading on a regulated market under this exemption makes a summary document available to the public in a language accepted by the competent authority of the Member State of the regulated market where admission is sought; (vi) that the summary document referred to in (v) is made available to the public in the Member State of the regulated market where admission to trading is sought in the manner set out in Article 14(2); and (vii) that the contents of the summary document shall comply with Article 5(2).

Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.
