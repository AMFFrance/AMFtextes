# Article 23 - Precautionary measures


1.  Where the competent authority of the host Member State finds that irregularities have been committed by the issuer or by the financial institutions in charge of the public offer or that the issuer has breached its obligations by reason of the fact that securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market, it shall refer those findings to the competent authority of the home Member State and to ESMA.

2.  If, despite the measures taken by the competent authority of the home Member State or because such measures prove inadequate, the issuer or the financial institution in charge of the public offer persists in breaching the relevant legal or regulatory provisions, the competent authority of the host Member State, after informing the competent authority of the home Member State and ESMA, shall take all appropriate measures in order to protect investors and shall inform the Commission and ESMA thereof at the earliest opportunity.
