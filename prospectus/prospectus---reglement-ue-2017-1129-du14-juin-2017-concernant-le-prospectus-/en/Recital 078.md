(78) In order to specify the requirements set out in this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the minimum information content of certain documents to be made available to the public in connection with a takeover by means of an exchange offer, a merger or a division, the scrutiny, approval, filing and review of the universal registration document and any amendments thereto as well as the conditions under which the status of frequent issuer is lost, the format of the prospectus, the base prospectus and the final terms, and the specific information which must be included in a prospectus, the minimum information to be included in the universal registration document, the reduced information to be included in the simplified prospectus in cases of secondary issuances and by SMEs, the specific reduced content and standardised format and sequence of the EU Growth prospectus and its specific summary, the criteria for assessment and presentation of risk factors by the issuer, the scrutiny and approval of prospectuses and the general equivalence criteria for prospectuses drawn up by third country issuers. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (15). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.
