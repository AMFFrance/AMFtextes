# Article 48 - Review


1.   Before 21 July 2022 the Commission shall present a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of this Regulation, accompanied where appropriate by a legislative proposal.

2.   The report shall assess, inter alia, whether the prospectus summary, the disclosure regimes set out in Articles 14 and 15 and the universal registration document referred to in Article 9 remain appropriate in light of their pursued objectives. In particular, the report shall include the following:

(a) the number of EU Growth prospectuses of persons in each of the four categories referred to in points (a) to (d) of Article 15(1) and an analysis of the evolution of each such number and of the trends in the choice of trading venues by the persons entitled to use the EU Growth prospectus;

(b) an analysis of whether the EU Growth prospectus strikes a proper balance between investor protection and the reduction of administrative burdens for the persons entitled to use it.

3.   Based on the analysis referred to in paragraph 2, the report shall assess whether any amendments to this Regulation are necessary in order to further facilitate capital-raising by smaller companies, while ensuring a sufficient level of investor protection, including whether the relevant thresholds need to be adjusted.

4.   Furthermore, the report shall evaluate whether LEIs and ISINs can be obtained at a reasonable cost and within a reasonable period by issuers, in particular SMEs. The report shall take into account the results of the peer review referred to in Article 20(13).
