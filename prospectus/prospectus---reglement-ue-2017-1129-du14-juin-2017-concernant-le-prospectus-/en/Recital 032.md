(32) The prospectus summary should be modelled as much as possible on the key information document required under Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8). Where securities fall under the scope of both this Regulation and Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, full reuse in the summary of the contents of the key information document would minimise compliance costs and administrative burdens for issuers, and this Regulation therefore facilitates such reuse. The requirement to produce a summary should however not be waived when a key information document is required, as the latter does not contain key information on the issuer and the offer to the public or admission to trading on a regulated market of the securities concerned.
