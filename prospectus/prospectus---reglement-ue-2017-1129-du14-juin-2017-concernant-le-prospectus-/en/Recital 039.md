(39) Frequent issuers should be incentivised to draw up their prospectus as separate documents, since that can reduce their cost of compliance with this Regulation and enable them to swiftly react to market windows. Thus, issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on regulated markets or MTFs should have the option, but not the obligation, to draw up and publish every financial year a universal registration document containing legal, business, financial, accounting and shareholding information and providing a description of the issuer for that financial year. On the condition that an issuer fulfils the criteria set out in this Regulation, the issuer should be deemed to be a frequent issuer as from the moment when the issuer submits the universal registration document for approval to the competent authority. Drawing up a universal registration document should enable the issuer to keep the information up-to-date and to draw up a prospectus when market conditions become favourable for an offer of securities to the public or an admission to trading on a regulated market by adding a securities note and a summary. The universal registration document should be multi-purpose insofar as its content should be the same irrespective of whether the issuer subsequently uses it for an offer of securities to the public or an admission to trading on a regulated market of equity or non-equity securities. Therefore, the disclosure standards for the universal registration document should be based on those for equity securities. The universal registration document should act as a source of reference on the issuer, supplying investors and analysts with the minimum information needed to make an informed judgement on the companyâ€™s business, financial position, earnings and prospects, governance and shareholding.
