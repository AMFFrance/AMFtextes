(20) Exemptions from the obligation to publish a prospectus under this Regulation should be able to be combined for an offer of securities to the public and/or an admission to trading on a regulated market, where the conditions for those exemptions are fulfilled at the same time. For example, where an offer is addressed simultaneously to qualified investors, to non-qualified investors that commit to invest at least EUR 100 000 each, to the employees of the issuer and, in addition, to a limited number of non-qualified investors not exceeding the number set out in this Regulation, that offer should be exempt from the obligation to publish a prospectus.
