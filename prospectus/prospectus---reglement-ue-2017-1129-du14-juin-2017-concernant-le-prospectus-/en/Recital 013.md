(13) Furthermore, in view of the varying sizes of financial markets across the Union, it is appropriate to give Member States the option of exempting offers of securities to the public not exceeding EUR 8 000 000 from the obligation to publish a prospectus as provided for in this Regulation. In particular, Member States should be free to set out in their national law a threshold between EUR 1 000 000 and EUR 8 000 000, expressed as the total consideration of the offer in the Union over a period of 12 months, below which the exemption should apply taking into account the level of domestic investor protection they deem to be appropriate. However, such exempted offers of securities to the public should not benefit from the passporting regime under this Regulation. Below that threshold, Member States should be able to require other disclosure requirements at national level to the extent that such requirements do not constitute a disproportionate or unnecessary burden in relation to such exempted offers of securities. Nothing in this Regulation should prevent those Member States from introducing rules at national level which allow the operators of multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) to determine the content of the admission document which an issuer is required to produce upon initial admission to trading of its securities or the modalities of its review.
