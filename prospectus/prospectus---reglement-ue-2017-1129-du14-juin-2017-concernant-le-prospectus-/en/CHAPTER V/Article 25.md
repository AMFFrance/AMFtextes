# Article 25 - Notification of prospectuses and supplements and communication of final terms


1.   The competent authority of the home Member State shall, at the request of the issuer, the offeror, the person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market or the person responsible for drawing up the prospectus and within one working day following receipt of that request or, where the request is submitted together with the draft prospectus, within one working day following the approval of the prospectus, notify the competent authority of the host Member State with a certificate of approval attesting that the prospectus has been drawn up in accordance with this Regulation and with an electronic copy of that prospectus.

Where applicable, the notification referred to in the first subparagraph shall be accompanied by a translation of the prospectus and any summary, produced under the responsibility of the issuer, the offeror, the person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market or the person responsible for drawing up the prospectus.

The same procedure shall be followed for any supplement to the prospectus.

The issuer, the offeror, the person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market or the person responsible for drawing up the prospectus shall be notified of the certificate of approval at the same time as the competent authority of the host Member State.

2.   Any application of the provisions of Article 18(1) and (2) shall be stated in the certificate of approval, as well as its justification.

3.   The competent authority of the home Member State shall notify ESMA of the certificate of approval of the prospectus or any supplement thereto at the same time as it is notified to the competent authority of the host Member State.

4.   Where the final terms of a base prospectus which has been previously notified are neither included in the base prospectus, nor in a supplement, the competent authority of the home Member State shall communicate them electronically to the competent authority of the host Member State(s) and to ESMA as soon as practicable after they are filed.

5.   No fee shall be charged by competent authorities for the notification, or receipt of notification, of prospectuses and supplements thereto, or any related supervisory activity, whether in the home Member State or in the host Member State(s).

6.   ESMA shall establish a notification portal into which each competent authority shall upload the certificates of approval and electronic copies referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and in Article 26(2), and the final terms of base prospectuses, for the purpose of the notifications and communications referred to in paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this Article and in Article 26.

All transfers of those documents between competent authorities shall take place through that notification portal.

7.   ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the technical arrangements necessary for the functioning of the notification portal referred to in paragraph 6.

ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 21 July 2018.

Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

8.   In order to ensure uniform conditions of application of this Regulation and to take account of technical developments on financial markets, ESMA may develop draft implementing technical standards to establish standard forms, templates and procedures for the notification of the certificate of approval, the prospectus, any supplement thereto and the translation of the prospectus and/or summary.

Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.
