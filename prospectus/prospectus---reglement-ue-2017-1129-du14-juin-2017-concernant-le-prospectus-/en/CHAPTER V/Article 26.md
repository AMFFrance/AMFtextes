# Article 26 - Notification of registration documents or universal registration documents


1.   This Article shall only apply to issues of non-equity securities referred to in point (m)(ii) of Article 2 and to issuers established in a third country referred to in point (m)(iii) of Article 2, where the home Member State chosen for the prospectus approval pursuant to those provisions is different from the Member State whose competent authority has approved the registration document or universal registration document drawn up by the issuer, the offeror or the person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market.

2.   A competent authority that has approved a registration document, or a universal registration document and any amendments thereto, shall, at the request of the issuer, the offeror, the person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market or the person responsible for drawing up such document, notify the competent authority of the home Member State for the prospectus approval with a certificate of approval attesting that the registration document, or universal registration document and any amendments thereto, has been drawn up in accordance with this Regulation and with an electronic copy of that document. That notification shall be made within one working day following receipt of the request or, where the request is submitted together with the draft registration document or draft universal registration document, within one working day following the approval of that document.

Where applicable, the notification referred to in the first subparagraph shall be accompanied by a translation of the registration document, or universal registration document and any amendments thereto, produced under the responsibility of the issuer, the offeror, the person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market or the person responsible for drawing up such documents.

The issuer, the offeror, the person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market or the person responsible for drawing up the registration document, or the universal registration document and any amendments thereto, shall be notified of the certificate of approval at the same time as the competent authority of the home Member State for the prospectus approval.

Any application of the provisions of Article 18(1) and (2) shall be stated in the certificate, as well as its justification.

The competent authority that has approved the registration document, or the universal registration document and any amendments thereto, shall notify ESMA of the certificate of approval of those documents at the same time as it is notified to the competent authority of the home Member State for the prospectus approval.

No fee shall be charged by those competent authorities for the notification, or receipt of notification, of registration documents, or universal registration documents and any amendments thereto, or any related supervisory activity.

3.   A registration document or universal registration document notified pursuant to paragraph 2 may be used as a constituent part of a prospectus submitted for approval to the competent authority of the home Member State for the prospectus approval.

The competent authority of the home Member State for the prospectus approval shall not undertake any scrutiny nor approval relating to the notified registration document, or universal registration document and any amendments thereto, and shall approve only the securities note and the summary, and only after receipt of the notification.

4.   A registration document or a universal registration document notified pursuant to paragraph 2 shall contain an appendix setting out the key information on the issuer referred to in Article 7(6). The approval of the registration document or universal registration document shall encompass the appendix.

Where applicable pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 27(2) and the second subparagraph of Article 27(3), the notification shall be accompanied by a translation of the appendix to the registration document or universal registration document produced under the responsibility of the issuer, offeror or person responsible for drawing up the registration document or the universal registration document.

When drawing up the summary, the issuer, offeror or person responsible for drawing up the prospectus shall reproduce the content of the appendix without any changes in the section referred to in point (b) of Article 7(4). The competent authority of the home Member State for the prospectus approval shall not scrutinise that section of the summary.

5.   Where a significant new factor, material mistake or material inaccuracy arises or is noted within the timeframe specified in Article 23(1) and relates to the information contained in the registration document or the universal registration document, the supplement required pursuant to Article 23 shall be submitted for approval to the competent authority which approved the registration document or the universal registration document. That supplement shall be notified to the competent authority of the home Member State for the prospectus approval within one working day following its approval, under the procedure set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article.

Where a registration document or a universal registration document is simultaneously used as a constituent part of several prospectuses, as provided for in Article 23(5), the supplement shall be notified to each competent authority which has approved such prospectuses.

6.   In order to ensure uniform conditions of application of this Regulation and to take account of technical developments on financial markets, ESMA may develop draft implementing technical standards to establish standard forms, templates and procedures for the notification of the certificate of approval relating to the registration document, the universal registration document, any supplement thereto and the translation thereof.

Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.
