(48) Once a class of securities is admitted to trading on a regulated market, investors are provided with ongoing disclosures by the issuer under Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10) and Directive 2004/109/EC. The need for a full prospectus is therefore less acute in cases of subsequent offers to the public or admissions to trading on a regulated market by such an issuer. A distinct simplified prospectus should therefore be available for use in cases of secondary issuances and its content should be alleviated compared to the normal regime, taking into account the information already disclosed. Still, investors need to be provided with consolidated and well-structured information, especially where such information is not required to be disclosed on an ongoing basis under Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 and Directive 2004/109/EC.
