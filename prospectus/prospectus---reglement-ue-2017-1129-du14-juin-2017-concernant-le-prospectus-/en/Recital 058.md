(58) Allowing issuers to incorporate by reference documents containing the information to be disclosed in a prospectus, subject to the requirement that such documents have been published electronically, should facilitate the procedure of drawing up a prospectus and lower the costs for the issuers without endangering investor protection. However, the aim of simplifying and reducing the costs of drafting a prospectus should not be achieved to the detriment of other interests the prospectus is meant to protect, including the accessibility of the information. The language used for information incorporated by reference should follow the language regime applying to prospectuses. Information incorporated by reference should be able to refer to historical data. However, where such information is no longer relevant due to material change, that should be clearly stated in the prospectus and the updated information should also be provided.
