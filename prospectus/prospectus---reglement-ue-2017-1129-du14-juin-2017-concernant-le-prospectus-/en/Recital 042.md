(42) Where an issuer draws up a prospectus consisting of separate documents, all constituent parts of the prospectus should be subject to approval, including, where applicable, the universal registration document and any amendments thereto, where they have been previously filed with the competent authority but not approved. Amendments to the universal registration document should not be subject to approval by the competent authority at the time of filing but should only be approved when all the constituent parts of the prospectus are submitted for approval.
