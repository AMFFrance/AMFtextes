(14) The mere admission of securities to trading on a MTF or the publication of bid and offer prices is not to be regarded in itself as an offer of securities to the public and is therefore not subject to the obligation to draw up a prospectus under this Regulation. A prospectus should only be required where those situations are accompanied by a communication constituting an ‘offer of securities to the public’ as defined in this Regulation.
