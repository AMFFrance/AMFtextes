(45) Provided that an issuer complies with the procedures for the filing, dissemination and storage of regulated information and with the deadlines set out in Articles 4 and 5 of Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (9), it should be allowed to publish the annual and half-yearly financial reports required under Directive 2004/109/EC as parts of the universal registration document, unless the home Member States of the issuer are different for the purposes of this Regulation and Directive 2004/109/EC and unless the language of the universal registration document does not fulfil the conditions of Article 20 of Directive 2004/109/EC. That should alleviate administrative burdens linked to multiple filings, without affecting the information available to the public or the supervision of those reports under Directive 2004/109/EC.
