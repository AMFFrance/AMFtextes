(44) Frequent issuers should be allowed to use a universal registration document and any amendments thereto as a constituent part of a base prospectus. Where a frequent issuer is eligible to draw up an EU Growth prospectus, a simplified prospectus under the simplified disclosure regime for secondary issuances or a wholesale prospectus for non-equity securities, it should be allowed to use its universal registration document and any amendments thereto as a constituent part of any such prospectus, instead of the specific registration document required under those disclosure regimes.
