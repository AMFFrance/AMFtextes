(60) Not all issuers have access to adequate information and guidance about the scrutiny and approval process and the necessary steps to follow to get a prospectus approved, as different approaches by competent authorities exist in Member States. This Regulation should eliminate those differences by harmonising the criteria for the scrutiny of the prospectus and harmonising the rules applying to the approval processes of competent authorities by streamlining them. It is important to ensure that all competent authorities take a convergent approach when scrutinising the completeness, consistency and comprehensibility of the information contained in a prospectus taking into account the need for a proportionate approach in the scrutiny of prospectuses based on the circumstances of the issuer and of the issuance. Guidance on how to seek the approval of a prospectus should be publicly available on the websites of the competent authorities. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) should play a key role in fostering supervisory convergence in that field by using its powers under Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12). In particular, ESMA should conduct peer reviews covering activities of the competent authorities under this Regulation within an appropriate time-frame before the review of this Regulation and in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.
