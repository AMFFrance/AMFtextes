(55) The market practice whereby an approved prospectus does not include the final offer price and/or the amount of securities to be offered to the public, whether expressed in number of securities or as an aggregate nominal amount, should be acceptable when such final offer price and/or amount cannot be included in the prospectus, provided that protection is granted to investors in that case. Investors should either be entitled to a right of withdrawal once the final offer price or amount of securities is known, or, alternatively, the prospectus should disclose the maximum price investors might have to pay for the securities, or the maximum amount of securities, or the valuation methods and criteria, and/or conditions, in accordance with which the price of the securities is to be determined and an explanation of any valuation methods used, such as the discounted cash flow method, a peer group analysis or any other commonly accepted valuation methods. The valuation methods and criteria should be precise enough to make the price predictable and ensure a level of investor protection that is similar to the disclosure of the maximum price of the offer. In that respect, a mere reference to the bookbuilding method would not be acceptable as valuation method or criteria where no maximum price is included in the prospectus.
