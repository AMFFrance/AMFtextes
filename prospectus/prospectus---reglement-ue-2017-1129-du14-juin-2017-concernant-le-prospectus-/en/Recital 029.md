(29) The presentation of risk factors in the summary should consist of a limited selection of specific risks which the issuer considers to be of most relevance to the investor when the investor is making an investment decision. The description of the risk factors in the summary should be of relevance to the specific offer and should be prepared solely for the benefit of investors and not give general statements on investment risk, or limit the liability of the issuer, offeror or any persons acting on their behalf. Those risk factors should, where applicable, highlight the risks, in particular for retail investors, in the case of securities issued by credit institutions that are subject to bail-in under DirectiveÂ 2014/59/EU.
