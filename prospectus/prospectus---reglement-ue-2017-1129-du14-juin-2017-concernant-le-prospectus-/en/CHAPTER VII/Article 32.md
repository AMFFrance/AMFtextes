(e) to prohibit or suspend advertisements or require issuers, offerors or persons asking for admission to trading on a regulated market, or relevant financial intermediaries to cease or suspend advertisements for a maximum of 10 consecutive working days on any single occasion where there are reasonable grounds for believing that this Regulation has been infringed;

Where necessary under national law, the competent authority may ask the relevant judicial authority to decide on the use of the powers referred to in the first subparagraph.

In the event that approval of a prospectus has been refused pursuant to point (k) of the first subparagraph, the competent authority shall inform ESMA thereof, which shall then inform the competent authorities of other Member States.
