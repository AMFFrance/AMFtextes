# Article 37 - Precautionary measures


1.   Where the competent authority of the host Member State has clear and demonstrable grounds for believing that irregularities have been committed by the issuer, the offeror or the person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market or by the financial intermediaries in charge of the offer of securities to the public or that those persons have infringed their obligations under this Regulation, it shall refer those findings to the competent authority of the home Member State and to ESMA.

2.   Where, despite the measures taken by the competent authority of the home Member State, the issuer, the offeror or the person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market or the financial intermediaries in charge of the offer of securities to the public persists in infringing this Regulation, the competent authority of the host Member State, after informing the competent authority of the home Member State and ESMA, shall take all appropriate measures in order to protect investors and shall inform the Commission and ESMA thereof without undue delay.

3.   Where a competent authority disagrees with any of the measures taken by another competent authority pursuant to paragraph 2, it may bring the matter to the attention of ESMA. ESMA may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.
