# Article 5 - Subsequent resale of securities


1.   Any subsequent resale of securities which were previously the subject of one or more of the types of offer of securities to the public listed in points (a) to (d) of Article 1(4) shall be considered as a separate offer and the definition set out in point (d) of Article 2 shall apply for the purpose of determining whether that resale is an offer of securities to the public. The placement of securities through financial intermediaries shall be subject to publication of a prospectus unless one of the exemptions listed in points (a) to (d) of Article 1(4) applies in relation to the final placement.

No additional prospectus shall be required in any such subsequent resale of securities or final placement of securities through financial intermediaries as long as a valid prospectus is available in accordance with Article 12 and the issuer or the person responsible for drawing up such prospectus consents to its use by means of a written agreement.

2.   Where a prospectus relates to the admission to trading on a regulated market of non-equity securities that are to be traded only on a regulated market, or a specific segment thereof, to which only qualified investors can have access for the purposes of trading in such securities, the securities shall not be resold to non-qualified investors, unless a prospectus is drawn up in accordance with this Regulation that is appropriate for non-qualified investors.
