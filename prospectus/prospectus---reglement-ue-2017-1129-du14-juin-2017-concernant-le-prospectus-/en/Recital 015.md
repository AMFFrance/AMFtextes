(15) Where an offer of securities is addressed exclusively to a restricted circle of investors who are not qualified investors, drawing up a prospectus represents a disproportionate burden in view of the small number of persons targeted by the offer, thus no prospectus should be required. That would apply for example in the case of an offer addressed to a limited number of relatives or personal acquaintances of the managers of a company.
