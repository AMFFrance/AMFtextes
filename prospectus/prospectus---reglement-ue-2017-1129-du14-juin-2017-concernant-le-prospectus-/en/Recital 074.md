(74) In line with the Communication of the Commission of 8 December 2010 on Reinforcing sanctioning regimes in the financial services sector and in order to ensure that the requirements of this Regulation are fulfilled, it is important that Member States take necessary steps to ensure that infringements of this Regulation are subject to appropriate administrative sanctions and other administrative measures. Those sanctions and measures should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and ensure a common approach in Member States and a deterrent effect. This Regulation should not limit Member States in their ability to provide for higher levels of administrative sanctions.
