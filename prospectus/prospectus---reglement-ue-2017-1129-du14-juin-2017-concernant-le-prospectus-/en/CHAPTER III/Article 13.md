# Article 13 - Minimum information and format


1.   The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 44 to supplement this Regulation regarding the format of the prospectus, the base prospectus and the final terms, and the schedules defining the specific information to be included in a prospectus, including LEIs and ISINs, avoiding duplication of information when a prospectus is composed of separate documents.

In particular, when setting out the various prospectus schedules, account shall be taken of the following:

(a) the various types of information needed by investors relating to equity securities as compared with non-equity securities; a consistent approach shall be taken with regard to information required in a prospectus for securities which have a similar economic rationale, notably derivative securities;

(b) the various types and characteristics of offers and admissions to trading on a regulated market of non-equity securities;

(c) the format used and the information required in base prospectuses relating to non-equity securities, including warrants in any form;

(d) where applicable, the public nature of the issuer;

(e) where applicable, the specific nature of the activities of the issuer.

For the purposes of point (b) of the second subparagraph, when setting out the various prospectus schedules, the Commission shall set out specific information requirements for prospectuses that relate to the admission to trading on a regulated market of non-equity securities which:

(a) are to be traded only on a regulated market, or a specific segment thereof, to which only qualified investors can have access for the purposes of trading in such securities; or

(b) have a denomination per unit of at least EUR 100 000.

Those information requirements shall be appropriate, taking into account the information needs of the investors concerned.

2.   The Commission shall, by 21 January 2019, adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 44 to supplement this Regulation by setting out the schedule defining the minimum information to be included in the universal registration document.

Such a schedule shall ensure that the universal registration document contains all the necessary information on the issuer so that the same universal registration document can be used equally for the subsequent offer to the public or admission to trading on a regulated market of equity or non-equity securities. With regard to the financial information, the operating and financial review and prospects and the corporate governance, such information shall be aligned as much as possible with the information required to be disclosed in the annual and half-yearly financial reports referred to in Articles 4 and 5 of Directive 2004/109/EC, including the management report and the corporate governance statement.

3.   The delegated acts referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be based on the standards in the field of financial and non-financial information set out by international securities commission organisations, in particular by the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), and on Annexes I, II and III to this Regulation.
