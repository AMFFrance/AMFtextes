# Article 15 - EU Growth prospectus


1.   The following persons may choose to draw up an EU Growth prospectus under the proportionate disclosure regime set out in this Article in the case of an offer of securities to the public provided that they have no securities admitted to trading on a regulated market:

(a) SMEs;

(b) issuers, other than SMEs, whose securities are traded or are to be traded on an SME growth market, provided that those issuers had an average market capitalisation of less than EUR 500 000 000 on the basis of end-year quotes for the previous three calendar years;

(c) issuers, other than those referred to in points (a) and (b), where the offer of securities to the public is of a total consideration in the Union that does not exceed EUR 20 000 000 calculated over a period of 12 months, and provided that such issuers have no securities traded on an MTF and have an average number of employees during the previous financial year of up to 499;

(d) offerors of securities issued by issuers referred to in points (a) and (b).

An EU Growth prospectus under the proportionate disclosure regime shall be a document of a standardised format, written in a simple language and which is easy for issuers to complete. It shall consist of a specific summary based on Article 7, a specific registration document and a specific securities note. The information in the EU Growth prospectus shall be presented in a standardised sequence in accordance with the delegated act referred to in paragraph 2.

2.   The Commission shall, by 21 January 2019, adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 44 to supplement this Regulation by specifying the reduced content and the standardised format and sequence for the EU Growth prospectus, as well as the reduced content and the standardised format of the specific summary.

The specific summary shall not impose any additional burdens or costs on issuers insofar as it shall only require the relevant information already included in the EU Growth prospectus. When specifying the standardised format of the specific summary, the Commission shall calibrate the requirements to ensure that it is shorter than the summary provided for in Article 7.

When specifying the reduced content and standardised format and sequence of the EU Growth prospectus, the Commission shall calibrate the requirements to focus on:

(a) the information that is material and relevant for investors when making an investment decision;

(b) the need to ensure proportionality between the size of the company and the cost of producing a prospectus.

In doing so, the Commission shall take into account the following:

(a) the need to ensure that the EU Growth prospectus is significantly lighter than the standard prospectus, in terms of administrative burdens and costs to issuers;

(b) the need to facilitate access to capital markets for SMEs and minimise costs for SMEs while ensuring investor confidence in investing in such companies;

(c) the various types of information relating to equity and non-equity securities needed by investors.

Those delegated acts shall be based on Annexes IV and V.
