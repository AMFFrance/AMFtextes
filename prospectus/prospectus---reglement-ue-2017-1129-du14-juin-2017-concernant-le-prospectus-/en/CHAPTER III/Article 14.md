# Article 14 - Simplified disclosure regime for secondary issuances


1.   The following persons may choose to draw up a simplified prospectus under the simplified disclosure regime for secondary issuances, in the case of an offer of securities to the public or of an admission to trading of securities on a regulated market:

(a) issuers whose securities have been admitted to trading on a regulated market or an SME growth market continuously for at least the last 18 months and who issue securities fungible with existing securities which have been previously issued;

(b) issuers whose equity securities have been admitted to trading on a regulated market or an SME growth market continuously for at least the last 18 months and who issue non-equity securities;

(c) offerors of securities admitted to trading on a regulated market or an SME growth market continuously for at least the last 18 months.

The simplified prospectus shall consist of a summary in accordance with Article 7, a specific registration document which may be used by persons referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph and a specific securities note which may be used by persons referred to in points (a) and (c) of that subparagraph.

2.   By way of derogation from Article 6(1), and without prejudice to Article 18(1), the simplified prospectus shall contain the relevant reduced information which is necessary to enable investors to understand:

(a) the prospects of the issuer and the significant changes in the business and the financial position of the issuer and the guarantor that have occurred since the end of the last financial year, if any;

(b) the rights attaching to the securities;

(c) the reasons for the issuance and its impact on the issuer, including on its overall capital structure, and the use of the proceeds.

The information contained in the simplified prospectus shall be written and presented in an easily analysable, concise and comprehensible form and shall enable investors to make an informed investment decision. It shall also take into account the regulated information that has already been disclosed to the public pursuant to Directive 2004/109/EC, where applicable, and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014.

3.   The Commission shall, by 21 January 2019, adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 44 to supplement this Regulation by setting out the schedules specifying the reduced information to be included under the simplified disclosure regime referred to in paragraph 1.

The schedules shall include in particular:

(a) the annual and half-yearly financial information published over the 12 months prior to the approval of the prospectus;

(b) where applicable, profit forecasts and estimates;

(c) a concise summary of the relevant information disclosed under Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 over the 12 months prior to the approval of the prospectus;

(d) risk factors;

(e) for equity securities, the working capital statement, the statement of capitalisation and indebtedness, a disclosure of relevant conflicts of interest and related-party transactions, major shareholders and, where applicable, pro forma financial information.

When specifying the reduced information to be included under the simplified disclosure regime, the Commission shall take into account the need to facilitate fundraising on capital markets and the importance of reducing the cost of capital. In order to avoid imposing unnecessary burdens on issuers, when specifying the reduced information, the Commission shall also take into account the information which an issuer is already required to disclose under Directive 2004/109/EC, where applicable, and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014. The Commission shall also calibrate the reduced information so that it focusses on the information that is relevant for secondary issuances and is proportionate.
