(27) Harmonisation of the information contained in the prospectus should provide equivalent investor protection at Union level. In order to enable investors to make an informed investment decision, that information should be sufficient and objective and should be written and presented in an easily analysable, concise and comprehensible form. The information which is included in a prospectus should be adapted to the type of prospectus, the nature and circumstances of the issuer, the type of securities, and whether the investors targeted by the offer are solely qualified investors. A prospectus should not contain information which is not material or specific to the issuer and the securities concerned, as that could obscure the information relevant to the investment decision and thus undermine investor protection.
