(85) The Commission should, by 21Â July 2022, review the application of this Regulation and assess in particular whether the disclosure regimes for secondary issuances and for the EU Growth prospectus, the universal registration document and the prospectus summary remain appropriate to meet the objectives pursued by this Regulation. In particular, the report should analyse the relevant figures and trends concerning the EU Growth prospectus and assess whether the new regime strikes a proper balance between investor protection and the reduction of administrative burdens for the companies entitled to use it. Such a review should also assess whether issuers, in particular SMEs, can obtain LEIs and ISINs at a reasonable cost and within a reasonable period.
