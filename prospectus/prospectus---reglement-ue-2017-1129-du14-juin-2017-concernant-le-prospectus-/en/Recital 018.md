(18) Dilutive issuances of shares or securities giving access to shares often indicate transactions with a significant impact on the issuerâ€™s capital structure, prospects and financial situation, for which the information contained in a prospectus is needed. In contrast, where an issuer has shares already admitted to trading on a regulated market, a prospectus should not be required for any subsequent admission of the shares of the same class on the same regulated market, including where such shares result from the conversion or exchange of other securities or from the exercise of the rights conferred by other securities, provided that the newly admitted shares represent a limited proportion in relation to shares of the same class already admitted to the same regulated market, unless such admission is combined with an offer of securities to the public falling within the scope of this Regulation. The same principle should apply more generally to securities fungible with securities already admitted to trading on a regulated market.
