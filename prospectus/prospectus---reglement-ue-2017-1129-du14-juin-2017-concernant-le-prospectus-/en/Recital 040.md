(40) An issuer which has filed and received approval for a universal registration document for two consecutive years can be considered well-known to the competent authority. All subsequent universal registration documents and any amendments thereto should therefore be allowed to be filed without prior approval and reviewed on an ex-post basis by the competent authority where that competent authority deems it necessary. Each competent authority should decide the frequency of such review taking into account for example its assessment of the risks of the issuer, the quality of its past disclosures, or the length of time elapsed since a filed universal registration document has been last reviewed.
