(24) In view of the specificities of different types of securities, issuers, offers and admissions, this Regulation sets out rules for different forms of prospectuses — a standard prospectus, a wholesale prospectus for non-equity securities, a base prospectus, a simplified prospectus for secondary issuances and an EU Growth prospectus. Therefore, all references to ‘prospectus’ under this Regulation are to be understood as referring to all those forms of prospectuses, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
