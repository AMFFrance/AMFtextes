1.   For the purpose of Article 29 and, where deemed necessary, for the purpose of Article 28, the competent authorities of Member States shall conclude cooperation arrangements with supervisory authorities of third countries concerning the exchange of information with supervisory authorities in third countries and the enforcement of obligations arising under this Regulation in third countries unless that third country, in accordance with a delegated act in force adopted by the Commission pursuant to Article 9 of Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council (25), is on the list of jurisdictions which have strategic deficiencies in their national anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism regimes that pose significant threats to the financial system of the Union. Those cooperation arrangements shall ensure at least an efficient exchange of information that allows the competent authorities to carry out their duties under this Regulation.

A competent authority shall inform ESMA and the other competent authorities where it proposes to enter into such an arrangement.

3.   The competent authorities shall conclude cooperation arrangements on exchange of information with the supervisory authorities of third countries only where the information disclosed is subject to guarantees of professional secrecy which are at least equivalent to those set out in Article 35. Such exchange of information must be intended for the performance of the tasks of those competent authorities.

4.   ESMA may, or where the Commission so requests shall, develop draft regulatory technical standards to determine the minimum content of the cooperation arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 and the template document to be used therefor.

Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.
