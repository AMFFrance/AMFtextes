(41) As long as it has not become a constituent part of an approved prospectus, it should be possible for the universal registration document to be amended, either voluntarily by the issuer — for example in the event of a material change in the organisation or financial situation of the issuer — or upon request by the competent authority in the context of an ex-post filing review where it is concluded that the standards of completeness, comprehensibility and consistency are not met. Such amendments should be published according to the same arrangements that apply to the universal registration document. In particular, when the competent authority identifies a material omission, a material mistake or a material inaccuracy, the issuer should amend its universal registration document and make that amendment publicly available without undue delay. As neither an offer to the public nor an admission to trading of securities is taking place, the procedure for amending a universal registration document should be distinct from the procedure for supplementing a prospectus, which should apply only after the approval of the prospectus.
