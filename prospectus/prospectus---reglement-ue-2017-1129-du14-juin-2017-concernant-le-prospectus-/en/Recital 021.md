(21) In order to ensure the proper functioning of the wholesale market for non-equity securities and increase market liquidity, it is important to set out a distinct alleviated treatment for non-equity securities admitted to trading on a regulated market and designed for qualified investors. Such alleviated treatment should comprise minimum information requirements that are less onerous than those applying to non-equity securities offered to retail investors, no requirement to include a summary in the prospectus, and more flexible language requirements. The alleviated treatment should be applicable to, firstly, non-equity securities, regardless of their denomination, which are traded only on a regulated market, or a specific segment thereof, to which only qualified investors can have access for the purposes of trading in such securities and, secondly, to non-equity securities with a denomination per unit of at least EUR 100 000, which reflects the higher investment capacity of the investors concerned by the prospectus. No resale to non-qualified investors should be allowed for non-equity securities that are traded only on a regulated market, or a specific segment thereof, to which only qualified investors can have access for the purposes of trading in such securities, unless a prospectus is drawn up in accordance with this Regulation that is appropriate for non-qualified investors. To that end, it is essential that market operators, when establishing such regulated markets, or a specific segment thereof, do not allow direct or indirect access by non-qualified investors to that regulated market or specific segment.
