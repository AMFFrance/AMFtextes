# Article 11 - Responsibility attaching to the prospectus


1.   Member States shall ensure that responsibility for the information given in a prospectus, and any supplement thereto, attaches to at least the issuer or its administrative, management or supervisory bodies, the offeror, the person asking for the admission to trading on a regulated market or the guarantor, as the case may be. The persons responsible for the prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall be clearly identified in the prospectus by their names and functions or, in the case of legal persons, their names and registered offices, as well as declarations by them that, to the best of their knowledge, the information contained in the prospectus is in accordance with the facts and that the prospectus makes no omission likely to affect its import.

2.   Member States shall ensure that their laws, regulations and administrative provisions on civil liability apply to those persons responsible for the information given in a prospectus.

However, Member States shall ensure that no civil liability shall attach to any person solely on the basis of the summary pursuant to Article 7 or the specific summary of an EU Growth prospectus pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 15(1), including any translation thereof, unless:

(a) it is misleading, inaccurate or inconsistent, when read together with the other parts of the prospectus; or

(b) it does not provide, when read together with the other parts of the prospectus, key information in order to aid investors when considering whether to invest in the securities.

3.   The responsibility for the information given in a registration document or in a universal registration document shall attach to the persons referred to in paragraph 1 only in cases where the registration document or the universal registration document is in use as a constituent part of an approved prospectus.

The first subparagraph shall apply without prejudice to Articles 4 and 5 of Directive 2004/109/EC where the information under those Articles is included in a universal registration document.
