(d) where a claim relating to the information contained in a prospectus is brought before a court, the plaintiff investor might, under national law, have to bear the costs of translating the prospectus before the legal proceedings are initiated;

(e) civil liability attaches only to those persons who have tabled the summary including any translation thereof, but only where the summary is misleading, inaccurate or inconsistent, when read together with the other parts of the prospectus, or where it does not provide, when read together with the other parts of the prospectus, key information in order to aid investors when considering whether to invest in such securities;

Where there is a substitution of content pursuant to the second subparagraph, the maximum length set out in paragraph 3 shall be extended by three additional sides of A4-sized paper. The content of the key information document shall be included as a distinct section of the summary. The page layout of that section shall clearly identify it as the content of the key information document as set out in points (c) to (i) of Article 8(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014.

Where, in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 8(9), a single summary covers several securities which differ only in some very limited details, such as the issue price or maturity date, the maximum length set out in paragraph 3 shall be extended by two additional sides of A4-sized paper. However, in the event that a key information document is required to be prepared for those securities under Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 and the issuer, the offeror or the person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market proceeds with the substitution of content referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph, the maximum length shall be extended by three additional sides of A4-sized paper for each additional security.

Where the summary contains the information referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph, the maximum length set out in paragraph 3 shall be extended by one additional side of A4-sized paper.

8.   The section referred to in point (d) of paragraph 4 shall contain the following information:

11.   The summary shall not contain cross-references to other parts of the prospectus or incorporate information by reference.

12.   Where a key information document is required to be prepared for securities offered to the public under Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 and a home Member State requires the issuer, the offeror or the person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market to substitute the content of the key information document in accordance with the second sentence of the second subparagraph of paragraph 7 of this Article, the persons advising on or selling the securities on behalf of the issuer, the offeror or the person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market shall be deemed to have fulfilled, during the offer period, the obligation to provide the key information document in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, provided that they instead provide the investors concerned with the summary of the prospectus under the timing and conditions set out in Articles 13 and 14 of that Regulation.

13.   ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the content and format of presentation of the key financial information referred to in point (b) of paragraph 6, and the relevant key financial information referred to in point (c)(iii) of paragraph 7, taking into account the various types of securities and issuers and ensuring that the information produced is concise and understandable.

ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 21 July 2018.

Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.
