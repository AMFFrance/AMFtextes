(a) the assets and liabilities, profits and losses, financial position, and prospects of the issuer and of any guarantor;

(b) the rights attaching to the securities; and

(c) the reasons for the issuance and its impact on the issuer.

That information may vary depending on any of the following:

(a) the nature of the issuer;

(b) the type of securities;

(c) the circumstances of the issuer;

(d) where relevant, whether or not the non-equity securities have a denomination per unit of at least EUR 100 000 or are to be traded only on a regulated market, or a specific segment thereof, to which only qualified investors can have access for the purposes of trading in the securities.

2.   The information in a prospectus shall be written and presented in an easily analysable, concise and comprehensible form, taking into account the factors set out in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1.

3.   The issuer, offeror or person asking for the admission to trading on a regulated market may draw up the prospectus as a single document or as separate documents.

The registration document shall contain the information relating to the issuer. The securities note shall contain the information concerning the securities offered to the public or to be admitted to trading on a regulated market.
