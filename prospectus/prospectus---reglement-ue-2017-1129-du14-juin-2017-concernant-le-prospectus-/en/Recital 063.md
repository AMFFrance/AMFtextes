(63) All prospectuses approved, or alternatively a list of those prospectuses with hyperlinks to the relevant dedicated website sections, should be published on the website of the competent authority of the issuer’s home Member State, and each prospectus should be transmitted by the competent authority to ESMA along with the relevant data enabling its classification. ESMA should provide a centralised storage mechanism of prospectuses allowing access free of charge and appropriate search facilities for the public. To ensure that investors have access to reliable data that can be used and analysed in a timely and efficient matter, certain information contained in the prospectuses, such as the ISINs identifying the securities and the legal entity identifiers (LEIs) identifying the issuers, offerors and guarantors, should be machine readable including when meta data is used. Prospectuses should remain publicly available for at least 10 years after their publication, to ensure that their period of public availability is aligned with that of annual and half-yearly financial reports under Directive 2004/109/EC. Prospectuses should always be available to investors on a durable medium, free of charge, upon request. Where a potential investor makes a specific demand for a paper copy, that investor should be able to receive a printed version of the prospectus. However, that does not require the issuer, the offeror, the person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market or the financial intermediary to keep in reserve printed copies of the prospectus to satisfy such potential requests.
