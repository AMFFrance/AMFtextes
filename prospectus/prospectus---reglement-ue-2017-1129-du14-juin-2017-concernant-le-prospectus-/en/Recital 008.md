(8) The disclosure requirements of this Regulation do not prevent a MemberÂ State or a competent authority or an exchange, through its rulebook, from imposing other particular requirements in the context of the admission to trading of securities on a regulated market, notably regarding corporate governance. Such requirements should not directly or indirectly restrict the drawing up, the content and the dissemination of a prospectus approved by a competent authority.
