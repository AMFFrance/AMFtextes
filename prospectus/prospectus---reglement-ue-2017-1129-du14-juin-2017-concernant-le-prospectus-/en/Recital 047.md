(47) By nature, information on taxes on the income from the securities in a prospectus can only be generic, adding little informational value for the individual investor. Since such information is to cover not only the country of registered office of the issuer but also the countries where the offer is being made or admission to trading on a regulated market is being sought, where a prospectus is passported, it is costly to produce and might hamper cross-border offers. Therefore, a prospectus should only contain a warning that the tax laws of the investor’s Member State and of the issuer’s Member State of incorporation might have an impact on the income received from the securities. However, the prospectus should still contain appropriate information on taxation where the proposed investment entails a specific tax regime, for instance in the case of investments in securities granting investors a favourable tax treatment.
