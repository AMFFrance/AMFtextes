(69) Where this Regulation allows an issuer to choose its home Member State for the purpose of the prospectus approval, it is appropriate to ensure that such issuer can use as a constituent part of its prospectus a registration document, or a universal registration document, which has already been approved by the competent authority of another Member State. A system of notification between competent authorities should therefore be introduced to ensure that such registration document, or universal registration document, is not subject to a scrutiny or approval by the competent authority approving the prospectus, and that competent authorities remain responsible only for the constituent part of a prospectus which they have approved, including in the event that a supplement is subsequently drawn up.
