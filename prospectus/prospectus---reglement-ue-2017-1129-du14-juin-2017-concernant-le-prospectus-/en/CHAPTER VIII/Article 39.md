(a) the gravity and the duration of the infringement;

(b) the degree of responsibility of the person responsible for the infringement;

(c) the financial strength of the person responsible for the infringement, as indicated by the total turnover of the responsible legal person or the annual income and net assets of the responsible natural person;

(d) the impact of the infringement on retail investors’ interests;

(e) the importance of the profits gained, losses avoided by the person responsible for the infringement or the losses for third parties derived from the infringement, insofar as they can be determined;

(f) the level of cooperation of the person responsible for the infringement with the competent authority, without prejudice to the need to ensure disgorgement of profits gained or losses avoided by that person;

(g) previous infringements by the person responsible for the infringement;

(h) measures taken after the infringement by the person responsible for the infringement to prevent its repetition.

2.   In the exercise of their powers to impose administrative sanctions and other administrative measures under Article 38, competent authorities shall cooperate closely to ensure that the exercise of their supervisory and investigative powers and the administrative sanctions and other administrative measures that they impose are effective and appropriate under this Regulation. They shall coordinate their action in order to avoid duplication and overlaps when exercising their supervisory and investigative powers and when imposing administrative sanctions and other administrative measures in cross-border cases.
