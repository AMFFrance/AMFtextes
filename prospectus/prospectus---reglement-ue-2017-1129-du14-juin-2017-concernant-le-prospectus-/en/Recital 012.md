(12) For offers of securities to the public with a total consideration in the Union of less than EUR 1 000 000, the cost of producing a prospectus in accordance with this Regulation is likely to be disproportionate to the envisaged proceeds of the offer. It is therefore appropriate that the obligation to draw up a prospectus under this Regulation should not apply to offers of such small scale. Member States should not extend the obligation to draw up a prospectus in accordance with this Regulation to offers of securities to the public with a total consideration below that threshold. However, Member States should be able to require other disclosure requirements at national level to the extent that such requirements do not constitute a disproportionate or unnecessary burden in relation to such offers of securities.
