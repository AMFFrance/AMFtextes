(30) The summary of the prospectus should be short, simple and easy for investors to understand. It should be written in plain, non-technical language, presenting the information in an easily accessible way. It should not be a mere compilation of excerpts from the prospectus. It is appropriate to set a maximum length for the summary in order to ensure that investors are not deterred from reading it and to encourage issuers to select the information which is essential for investors. In certain circumstances set out in this Regulation, the maximum length of the summary should be extended.
