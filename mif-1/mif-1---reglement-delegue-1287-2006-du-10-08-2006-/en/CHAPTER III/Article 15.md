# Article 15 - Request for cooperation and exchange of information


1.   Where a competent authority wishes another competent authority to supply or exchange information in accordance with Article 58(1) of Directive 2004/39/EC, it shall submit a written request to that competent authority containing sufficient detail to enable it to provide the information requested.

However, in a case of urgency, the request may be transmitted orally provided that it is confirmed in writing.

The competent authority which receives a request shall acknowledge receipt as soon as practicable.

2.   Where the information requested under paragraph 1 is internally available to the competent authority that receives the request, that authority shall transmit the requested information without delay to the competent authority which made the request.

However, if the competent authority that receives the request does not possess or control the information requested, it shall immediately take the necessary steps to obtain that information and to comply fully with the request. That competent authority shall also inform the competent authority that made the request of the reasons for not sending immediately the information requested.
