(25) A derivative contract should be understood as relating to a commodity or to another factor where there is a direct link between that contract and the relevant underlying commodity or factor. A derivative contract on the price of a commodity should therefore be regarded as a derivative contract relating to the commodity, while a derivative contract on the transportation costs for the commodity should not be regarded as a derivative contract relating to the commodity. A derivative that relates to a commodity derivative, such as an option on a commodity future (a derivative relating to a derivative) would constitute an indirect investment in commodities and should therefore still be regarded as a commodity derivative for the purposes of Directive 2004/39/EC.
