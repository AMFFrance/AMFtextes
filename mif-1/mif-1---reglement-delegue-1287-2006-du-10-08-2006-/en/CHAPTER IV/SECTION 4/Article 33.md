# Article 33 - Calculations and estimates for shares admitted to trading on a regulated market


1.   In respect of each share that is admitted to trading on a regulated market, the relevant competent authority for that share shall ensure that the following calculations are made in respect of that share promptly after the end of each calendar year:

(a) the average daily turnover;

(b) the average daily number of transactions;

(c) for those shares which satisfy the conditions laid down in Article 22(1)(a) or (b) (as applicable), the free float as at 31 December;

(d) if the share is a liquid share, the average value of the orders executed.

This paragraph and paragraph 2 shall not apply to a share which is first admitted to trading on a regulated market four weeks or less before the end of the calendar year.

2.   The calculation of the average daily turnover, average value of the orders executed and average daily number of transactions shall take into account all the orders executed in the Community in respect of the share in question between 1 January and 31 December of the preceding year, or, where applicable, that part of the year during which the share was admitted to trading on a regulated market and was not suspended from trading on a regulated market.

In the calculations of the average daily turnover, average value of the orders executed and average daily number of transactions of a share, non-trading days in the Member State of the relevant competent authority for that share shall be excluded.

3.   Before the first admission of a share to trading on a regulated market, the relevant competent authority for that share shall ensure that estimates are provided, in respect of that share, of the average daily turnover, the market capitalisation as it will stand at the start of the first day of trading and, where the estimate of the market capitalisation is EUR 500 million or more:

(a) the average daily number of transactions and, for those shares which satisfy the conditions laid down in Article 22(1)(a) or (b) (as applicable), the free float;

(b) in the case of a share that is estimated to be a liquid share, the average value of the orders executed.

The estimates shall relate to the six-week period following admission to trading, or the end of that period, as applicable, and shall take account of any previous trading history of the share, as well as that of shares that are considered to have similar characteristics.

4.   After the first admission of a share to trading on a regulated market, the relevant competent authority for that share shall ensure that, in respect of that share, the figures referred to in points (a) to (d) of paragraph 1 are calculated, using data relating to the first four weeks’ trading, as if a reference in point (c) of paragraph 1 to 31 December were a reference to the end of the first four weeks’ trading, as soon as practicable after those data are available, and in any case before the end of the six-week period referred to in Article 22(5).

5.   During the course of a calendar year, the relevant competent authorities shall ensure the review and where necessary the recalculation of the average daily turnover, average value of the orders executed, average daily number of transactions executed and the free float whenever there is a change in relation to the share or the issuer which significantly affects the previous calculations on an ongoing basis.

6.   The calculations referred to in paragraphs 1 to 5 which are to be published on or before the first trading day in March 2009 shall be made on the basis of the data relating to the regulated market or markets of the Member State which is the most relevant market in terms of liquidity for the share in question. For those purposes, negotiated transactions within the meaning of Article 19 shall be excluded from the calculations.
