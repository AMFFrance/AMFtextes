(24) The definition of a commodity should not affect any other definition of that term in national legislation and other community legislation. The tests for determining whether a contract should be considered as having the characteristics of other derivative financial instruments and not being for commercial purposes are only intended to be used for the purposes of determining whether contracts fall within Section C(7) or C(10) of AnnexÂ I to Directive 2004/39/EC.
