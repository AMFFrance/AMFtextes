The best bid and offer by price of each market maker in that share, together with the volumes attaching to those prices. Periodic auction trading system A system that matches orders on the basis of a periodic auction and a trading algorithm operated without human intervention. The price at which the auction trading system would best satisfy its trading algorithm and the volume that would potentially be executable at that price.
