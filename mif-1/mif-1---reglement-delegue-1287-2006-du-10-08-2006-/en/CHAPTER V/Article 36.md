# Article 36 - Units in collective investment undertakings


1.   A regulated market shall, when admitting to trading units in a collective investment undertaking, whether or not that undertaking is constituted in accordance with Directive 85/611/EEC, satisfy itself that the collective investment undertaking complies or has complied with the registration, notification or other procedures which are a necessary precondition for the marketing of the collective investment undertaking in the jurisdiction of the regulated market.

2.   Without prejudice to Directive 85/611/EEC or any other Community legislation or national law relating to collective investment undertakings, Member States may provide that compliance with the requirements referred to in paragraph 1 is not a necessary precondition for the admission of units in a collective investment undertaking to trading on a regulated market.

3.   When assessing whether units in an open-ended collective investment undertaking are capable of being traded in a fair, orderly and efficient manner in accordance with Article 40(1) of Directive 2004/39/EC, the regulated market shall take the following aspects into account:

(a) the distribution of those units to the public;

(b) whether there are appropriate market-making arrangements, or whether the management company of the scheme provides appropriate alternative arrangements for investors to redeem the units;

(c) whether the value of the units is made sufficiently transparent to investors by means of the periodic publication of the net asset value.

4.   When assessing whether units in a closed-end collective investment undertaking are capable of being traded in a fair, orderly and efficient manner in accordance with Article 40(1) of Directive 2004/39/EC, the regulated market shall take the following aspects into account:

(a) the distribution of those units to the public;

(b) whether the value of the units is made sufficiently transparent to investors, either by publication of information on the fund's investment strategy or by the periodic publication of net asset value.
