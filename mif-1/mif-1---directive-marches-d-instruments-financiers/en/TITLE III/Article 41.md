# Article 41 - Suspension and removal of instruments from trading


1.  Without prejudice to the right of the competent authority under Article 50(2)(j) and (k) to demand suspension or removal of an instrument from trading, the operator of the regulated market may suspend or remove from trading a financial instrument which no longer complies with the rules of the regulated market unless such a step would be likely to cause significant damage to the investors' interests or the orderly functioning of the market.

Notwithstanding the possibility for the operators of regulated markets to inform directly the operators of other regulated markets, Member States shall require that an operator of a regulated market that suspends or removes from trading a financial instrument make public this decision and communicates relevant information to the competent authority. The competent authority shall inform the competent authorities of the other Member States.

2.  A competent authority which requests the suspension or removal of a financial instrument from trading on one or more regulated markets shall immediately make public its decision and inform ESMA and the competent authorities of the other Member States. Save where it is likely to cause significant damage to the investors’ interests or the orderly functioning of the internal market, the competent authorities of the other Member States shall request the suspension or removal of that financial instrument from trading on the regulated markets and MTFs that operate under their supervision.
