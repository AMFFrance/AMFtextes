1.   Member States shall require investment firms to satisfy the following conditions when carrying out client orders:

(a) they must ensure that orders executed on behalf of clients are promptly and accurately recorded and allocated;

(b) they must carry out otherwise comparable client orders sequentially and promptly unless the characteristics of the order or prevailing market conditions make this impracticable, or the interests of the client require otherwise;
