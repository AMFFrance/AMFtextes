# Article 51 - Retention of records


1.   Member States shall require investment firms to retain all the records required under Directive 2004/39/EC and its implementing measures for a period of at least five years.

Additionally, records which set out the respective rights and obligations of the investment firm and the client under an agreement to provide services, or the terms on which the firm provides services to the client, shall be retained for at least the duration of the relationship with the client.

However, competent authorities may, in exceptional circumstances, require investment firms to retain any or all of those records for such longer period as is justified by the nature of the instrument or transaction, if that is necessary to enable the authority to exercise its supervisory functions under Directive 2004/39/EC.

Following the termination of the authorisation of an investment firm, Member States or competent authorities may require the firm to retain records for the outstanding term of the five year period required under the first subparagraph.

2.   The records shall be retained in a medium that allows the storage of information in a way accessible for future reference by the competent authority, and in such a form and manner that the following conditions are met:

(a) the competent authority must be able to access them readily and to reconstitute each key stage of the processing of each transaction;

(b) it must be possible for any corrections or other amendments, and the contents of the records prior to such corrections or amendments, to be easily ascertained;

(c) it must not be possible for the records otherwise to be manipulated or altered.

3.   The competent authority of each Member State shall draw up and maintain a list of the minimum records investment firms are required to keep under Directive 2004/39/EC and its implementing measures.

4.   Record-keeping obligations under Directive 2004/39/EC and in this Directive are without prejudice to the right of Member States to impose obligations on investment firms relating to the recording of telephone conversations or electronic communications involving client orders.

5.   Before 31 December 2009 the Commission shall, in the light of discussions with the Committee of European Securities Regulators, report to the European Parliament and the Council on the continued appropriateness of the provisions of paragraph 4.
