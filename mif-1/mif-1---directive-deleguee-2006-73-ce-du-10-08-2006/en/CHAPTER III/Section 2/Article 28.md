(a) to treat as a professional or retail client a client that might otherwise be classified as an eligible counterparty pursuant to Article 24(2) of Directive 2004/39/EC;

(b) to treat as a retail client a client that is considered as a professional client pursuant to Section I of Annex II to Directive 2004/39/EC.
