(34) Notwithstanding the fact that an ELTIF is not required to offer redemption rights before the end of its life, nothing should prevent an ELTIF from seeking admission of its units or shares to a regulated market or to a multilateral trading facility, thus providing investors with an opportunity to sell their units or shares before the end of the life of the ELTIF. The rules or instruments of incorporation of an ELTIF should not prevent units or shares of the ELTIF being admitted to trading on a regulated market or on a multilateral trading facility, nor should they prevent investors from freely transferring their units or shares to third parties who wish to purchase those units or shares. This is intended to promote secondary markets as an important venue for retail investors for buying and selling units or shares of ELTIFs.
