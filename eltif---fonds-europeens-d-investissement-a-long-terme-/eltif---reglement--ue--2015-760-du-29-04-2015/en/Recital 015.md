(15) The definition of what constitutes a long-term investment is broad. Eligible investment assets are generally illiquid, require commitments for a certain period of time, and have an economic profile of a long-term nature. Eligible investment assets are non-transferable securities and therefore do not have access to the liquidity of secondary markets. They often require fixed term commitments which restrict their marketability. Nevertheless, as listed SMEs may face problems of liquidity and access to the secondary market, they should also be considered to be qualifying portfolio undertakings. The economic cycle of the investment sought by ELTIFs is essentially of a long-term nature due to the high capital commitments and the length of time required to produce returns.
