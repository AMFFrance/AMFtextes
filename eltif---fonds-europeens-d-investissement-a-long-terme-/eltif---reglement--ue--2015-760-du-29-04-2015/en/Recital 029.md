(29) In order to allow managers of ELTIFs to raise further capital during the life of the fund, they should be permitted to borrow cash amounting to up to 30 % of the value of the capital of the ELTIF. That should serve to provide additional return to the investors. In order to eliminate the risk of currency mismatches, the ELTIF should borrow only in the currency in which the manager of the ELTIF expects to acquire the asset. In order to address concerns related to shadow banking activities, the cash borrowed by the ELTIF should not be used for granting loans to qualifying portfolio undertakings.
