(40) The unlisted assets in which an ELTIF has invested may obtain a listing on a regulated market during the life of the fund. Where that happens, the assets may no longer comply with the non-listing requirement of this Regulation. In order to allow the manager of the ELTIF to disinvest in an orderly manner from such assets that would no longer be eligible, the assets could continue to count towards the 70 % limit of eligible investment assets for up to three years.
