(12) In order to ensure the compliance of ELTIFs with the harmonised rules governing the activity of these funds, it is necessary to require competent authorities to authorise ELTIFs. The harmonised authorisation and supervision procedures for AIFMs under Directive 2011/61/EU should therefore be supplemented with a special authorisation procedure for ELTIFs. Procedures should be put in place to ensure that only EU AIFMs authorised in accordance with Directive 2011/61/EU and capable of managing an ELTIF may manage ELTIFs. All appropriate steps should be taken to ensure that an ELTIF will be able to comply with the harmonised rules governing the activity of these funds. A specific authorisation procedure should apply where the ELTIF is internally managed and no external AIFM is appointed.
