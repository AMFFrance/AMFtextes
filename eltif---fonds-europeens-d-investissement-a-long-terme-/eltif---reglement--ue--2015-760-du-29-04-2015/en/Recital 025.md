(25) Where the manager of an ELTIF holds a stake in a portfolio undertaking, there is a risk that the manager puts its own interests ahead of the interests of investors in the ELTIF. To avoid such a conflict of interests, and to ensure sound corporate governance, an ELTIF should only invest in assets that are unrelated to the manager of the ELTIF, unless the ELTIF invests in units or shares of other ELTIFs, EuVECAs, or EuSEFs that are managed by the manager of the ELTIF.
