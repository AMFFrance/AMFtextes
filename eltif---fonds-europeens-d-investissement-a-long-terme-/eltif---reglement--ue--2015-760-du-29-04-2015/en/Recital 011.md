(11) Uniform rules should apply to all EU AIFs that wish to market themselves as ELTIFs. EU AIFs that do not wish to market themselves as ELTIFs should not be bound by these rules, thereby also accepting that they do not benefit from the advantages that ensue. Undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and non-EU AIFs should not be eligible for marketing as ELTIFs.
