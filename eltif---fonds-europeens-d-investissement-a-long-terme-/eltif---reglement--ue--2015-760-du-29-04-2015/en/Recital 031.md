(31) ELTIFs, on account of their portfolio profile and their focus on categories of long-term assets, are designed to channel private savings toward the European economy. ELTIFs are also conceived as an investment vehicle through which the European Investment Bank (the EIB) Group can channel its European infrastructure or SME financing. By virtue of this Regulation, ELTIFs are structured as a pooled investment vehicle that responds to the EIB Group's focus on contributing to a balanced and steady development of an internal market for long-term investments in the interest of the Union. Given their focus on categories of long-term assets, ELTIFs can fulfil their designated role as a priority tool to accomplish the Investment Plan for Europe set out in the Commission communication of 26 November 2014.
