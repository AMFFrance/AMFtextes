(41) Given the specific characteristics of ELTIFs, as well as of the retail and professional investors they target, it is important that sound transparency requirements be put in place that are capable of allowing prospective investors to make an informed judgement and be fully aware of the risks involved. In addition to complying with the transparency requirements contained in Directive 2011/61/EU, ELTIFs should publish a prospectus the content of which should include all information required to be disclosed by collective investment undertakings of the closed-end type in accordance with Directive 2003/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 809/2004 (10). When marketing an ELTIF to retail investors, it should be mandatory to publish a key information document in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11). Furthermore, any marketing documents should explicitly draw attention to the risk profile of the ELTIF.
