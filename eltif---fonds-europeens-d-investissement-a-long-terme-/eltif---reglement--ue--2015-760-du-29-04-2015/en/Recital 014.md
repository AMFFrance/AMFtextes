(14) In order to ensure that ELTIFs target long-term investments and contribute to the financing of a sustainable growth of the Union's economy, rules on the portfolio of ELTIFs should require the clear identification of the categories of assets that are eligible for investment by ELTIFs, and of the conditions under which they should be eligible. An ELTIF should invest at least 70 % of its capital in eligible investment assets. In order to ensure the integrity of ELTIFs, it is also desirable to prohibit an ELTIF from engaging in certain financial transactions that might endanger its investment strategy and objectives by giving rise to risks that are different from those that might be expected for a fund targeting long-term investments. In order to ensure a clear focus on long-term investments, as may be useful for retail investors unfamiliar with less conventional investment strategies, an ELTIF should not be allowed to invest in financial derivative instruments other than for the purpose of hedging the risks inherent to its own investments. Given the liquid nature of commodities and the financial derivative instruments that give an indirect exposure to them, investments in commodities do not require a long-term investor commitment and therefore should be excluded from eligible investment assets. That rationale does not apply to investments in infrastructure or companies related to commodities or whose performance is linked indirectly to the performance of commodities, such as farms in the case of agricultural commodities or power plants in the case of energy commodities.
