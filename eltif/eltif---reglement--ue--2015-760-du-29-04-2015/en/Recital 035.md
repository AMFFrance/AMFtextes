(35) While individual investors may be interested in investing in an ELTIF, the illiquid nature of most investments in long-term projects precludes an ELTIF from offering regular redemptions to its investors.

ELTIFs should, consequently, be structured in principle so as not to offer regular redemptions before the end of the life of the ELTIF.
