(50) ESMA should play a central role in the application of the rules concerning ELTIFs, by ensuring consistent application of Union rules by national competent authorities. As a body with highly specialised expertise regarding securities and securities markets, it is efficient and appropriate to entrust ESMA with the drawing up of draft regulatory technical standards which do not involve policy choices for submission to the Commission. These regulatory technical standards should concern the circumstances in which the use of financial derivative instruments solely serves the purpose of hedging the risks inherent to the investments, the circumstances in which the life of an ELTIF will be sufficient in length to cover the life-cycle of each of the individual assets of the ELTIF, the features of the schedule for the orderly disposal of ELTIF assets, the definitions of, and calculation methodologies for costs borne by investors, presentation of cost disclosures, and the characteristics of the facilities to be set up by ELTIFs in each Member State where they intend to market units or shares.
