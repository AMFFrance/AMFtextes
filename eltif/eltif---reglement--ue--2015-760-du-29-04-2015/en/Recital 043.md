(43) As ELTIFs target not only professional but also retail investors across the Union, it is necessary that certain additional requirements be added to the marketing requirements already laid down in Directive 2011/61/EU, in order to ensure an appropriate degree of retail investor protection. Accordingly, facilities should be made available for making subscriptions, making payments to unit- or shareholders, repurchasing or redeeming units or shares, and making available the information which the ELTIF and the manager of the ELTIF are required to provide. Moreover, in order to ensure that retail investors are not at a disadvantage relative to professional investors, certain safeguards should be put in place when ELTIFs are marketed to retail investors. In the event that the marketing or placing of ELTIFs to retail investors is done through a distributor, such distributor should comply with the relevant requirements of Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13).
