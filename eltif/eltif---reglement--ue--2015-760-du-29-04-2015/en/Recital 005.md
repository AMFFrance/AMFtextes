(5) In the absence of a regulation setting out rules on ELTIFs, diverging measures might be adopted at national level, which are likely to cause distortions of competition resulting from differences in investment protection measures. Diverging national requirements on portfolio composition, diversification, and eligible assets, in particular investment in commodities, create obstacles to the cross-border marketing of investment funds that focus on unlisted undertakings and real assets because investors cannot easily compare the different investment propositions offered to them. Diverging national requirements also lead to different levels of investor protection. Furthermore, diverging national requirements pertaining to investment techniques, such as the permitted levels of borrowing, use of financial derivative instruments, rules applicable to short selling or to securities financing transactions, lead to discrepancies in the level of investor protection. In addition, diverging national requirements on redemption or holding periods impede the cross-border selling of funds investing in unlisted assets. By increasing legal uncertainty, those divergences can undermine the confidence of investors when considering investments in such funds and reduce the scope for investors to choose effectively between various long-term investment opportunities. Consequently, the appropriate legal basis for this Regulation is Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as interpreted by consistent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.
