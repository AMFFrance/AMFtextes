(10) The new rules applicable to ELTIFs should build on the existing regulatory framework established by Directive 2011/61/EU and the acts adopted for its implementation. Therefore, the product rules concerning ELTIFs should apply in addition to the rules laid down in existing Union law. In particular, the management and marketing rules laid down in Directive 2011/61/EU should apply to ELTIFs. Equally, the rules on the cross-border provision of services and freedom of establishment laid down in Directive 2011/61/EU should apply correspondingly to the cross-border activities of ELTIFs. These should be supplemented by specific marketing rules designed for the cross-border marketing of ELTIFs to both retail and professional investors across the Union.
