(21) To reflect existing business practices, an ELTIF should be allowed to buy existing shares of a qualifying portfolio undertaking from existing shareholders of that undertaking. In addition, for the purposes of ensuring the widest possible opportunities for fundraising, investments in other ELTIFs, European Venture Capital Funds (EuVECAs), regulated by Regulation (EU) No 345/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), and European Social Entrepreneurship Funds (EuSEFs), regulated by Regulation (EU) No 346/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), should be permitted. To prevent dilution of the investments in qualifying portfolio undertakings, ELTIFs should only be permitted to invest in other ELTIFs, EuVECAs, and EuSEFs provided that they have not themselves invested more than 10 % of their capital in other ELTIFs.
