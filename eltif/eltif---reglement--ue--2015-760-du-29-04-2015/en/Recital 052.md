(52) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to ensure uniform requirements on the investments and operating conditions for ELTIFs throughout the Union, while taking full account of the need to balance safety and reliability of ELTIFs with the efficient operation of the market for long-term financing and the cost for its various stakeholders, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of their scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
