(17) Eligible investment assets should be understood to include participations, such as equity or quasi-equity instruments, debt instruments in qualifying portfolio undertakings, and loans provided to them. They should also include participations in other funds that are focused on assets, such as investments in unlisted undertakings that issue equity or debt instruments for which there is not always a readily identifiable buyer. Direct holdings of real assets, unless they are securitised, should also form a category of eligible assets, provided that they yield a predictable cash flow, whether regular or irregular, in the sense that they can be modelled and valued based on a discounted cash flow valuation method. Those assets could indicatively include social infrastructure that yields a predictable return, such as energy, transport and communication infrastructure, as well as education, health, welfare support or industrial facilities. Conversely, assets such as works of art, manuscripts, wine stocks or jewellery should not be eligible as they do not normally yield a predictable cash flow.
