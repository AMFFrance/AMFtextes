(37) In order for investors to redeem effectively their units or shares at the end of the ELTIF's life, the manager of the ELTIF should start to sell the portfolio of assets of the ELTIF in good time to ensure that its value is properly realised. In determining an orderly disinvestment schedule, the manager of the ELTIF should take into account the different maturity profiles of the investments and the length of time necessary to find a buyer for the assets in which the ELTIF is invested. Due to the impracticality of maintaining the investment limits during this liquidation period, they should cease to apply when the liquidation period starts.
