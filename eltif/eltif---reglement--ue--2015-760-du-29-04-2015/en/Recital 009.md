(9) Whereas Directive 2011/61/EU also provides for a staged third-country regime governing non-EU AIFMs and non-EU AIFs, the new rules on ELTIFs have a more limited scope emphasising the European dimension of the new long-term investment product. Accordingly, only an EU AIF as defined in Directive 2011/61/EU should be eligible to become an ELTIF and only if it is managed by an EU AIFM that has been authorised in accordance with Directive 2011/61/EU.
