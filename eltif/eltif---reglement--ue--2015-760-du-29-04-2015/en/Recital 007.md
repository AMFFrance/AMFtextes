(7) It is essential to ensure that the rules on the operation of ELTIFs, in particular regarding the composition of their portfolio and the investment instruments that they are allowed to use, be directly applicable to the managers of ELTIFs and, therefore, these new rules need to be adopted as a Regulation. This also ensures uniform conditions for the use of the designation ‘ELTIF’, by preventing the emergence of diverging national requirements. Managers of ELTIFs should follow the same rules across the Union in order to enhance the confidence of investors in ELTIFs and ensure enduring trustworthiness of the ‘ELTIF’ designation. At the same time, by adopting uniform rules, the complexity of the regulatory requirements applicable to ELTIFs is reduced. By means of uniform rules, the managers' cost of compliance with diverging national requirements governing funds that invest in listed and unlisted undertakings and comparable categories of real assets is also reduced. This is especially true for managers of ELTIFs that wish to raise capital on a cross-border basis. The adoption of uniform rules also contributes to the elimination of competitive distortions.
