(36) In order to incentivise investors, in particular retail investors, who might not be willing to lock their capital up for a long period of time, an ELTIF should be able to offer, under certain conditions, early redemption rights to its investors. Therefore, the manager of the ELTIF should be given discretion to decide whether to establish ELTIFs with or without redemption rights, according to the ELTIF's investment strategy. When a redemption rights regime is in place, those rights and their main features should be clearly predefined and disclosed in the rules or instruments of incorporation of the ELTIF.
