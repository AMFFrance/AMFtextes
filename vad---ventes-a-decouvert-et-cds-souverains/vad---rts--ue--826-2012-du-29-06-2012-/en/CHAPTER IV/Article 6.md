# Article 6 - Turnover calculation to determine the principal venue for the trading of a share


1.   When calculating turnover pursuant to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 236/2012, a relevant competent authority shall use the best available information, which may include:

(a) publicly available information;

(b) transaction data obtained under Article 25(3) of Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3);

(c) information from trading venues where the relevant share is traded;

(d) information provided by another competent authority, including a competent authority of a third country;

(e) information provided by the issuer of the relevant share;

(f) information from other third parties, including data providers.

2.   In determining what constitutes the best available information, a relevant competent authority shall ensure so far as reasonably possible that:

(a) it uses publicly available information in preference to other sources of information;

(b) the information covers all trading sessions during the relevant period, irrespective of whether the share traded during all of the sessions;

(c) transactions received and included in the calculations are counted only once;

(d) transactions reported through a trading venue but executed outside it are not counted.

3.   The turnover of a share on a trading venue shall be deemed to be zero where the share is no longer admitted to trading on that trading venue even if the share was admitted to trading on the trading venue during the relevant calculation period.
