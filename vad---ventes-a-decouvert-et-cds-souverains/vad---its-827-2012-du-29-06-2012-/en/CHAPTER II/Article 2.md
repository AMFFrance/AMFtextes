# Article 2 - Means by which information may be disclosed to the public


Information on net short positions in shares shall be disclosed to the public by posting it on a central website operated or supervised by the relevant competent authority pursuant to Article 9(4) of Regulation (EU) No 236/2012. The information shall be disclosed to the public through means which:

(a) publish it in the format specified in Annex I in such a way as to allow the public consulting the website to access one or more tables offering all the relevant information on positions per share issuer;

(b) allow users to identify and filter on whether the net short positions in a share issuer at the time of accessing the website has reached or exceeded the relevant publication threshold;

(c) provide for historical data on the published net short positions in a share issuer;

(d) include, whenever technically possible, downloadable files with the published and historical net short positions in a machine-readable format, meaning that the files are sufficiently structured for software applications to identify reliably individual statements of fact and their internal structure;

(e) show for one day, together with the information specified in point (b), the net short positions that are published because they have fallen below the publication threshold of 0,5 % of the issued share capital, before removing and transferring the information to a historical data section.
