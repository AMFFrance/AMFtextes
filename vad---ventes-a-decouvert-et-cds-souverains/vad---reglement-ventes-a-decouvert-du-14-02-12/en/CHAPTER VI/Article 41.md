In accordance with Regulation (EU) NoÂ 1095/2010, ESMA may adopt guidelines to ensure a consistent approach is taken concerning the penalties and administrative measures to be established by Members States.

Member States shall notify the Commission and ESMA of the provisions referred to in the first and second subparagraphs by 1 July 2012 and shall notify them without delay of any subsequent amendment affecting those provisions.

ESMA shall publish on its website and update regularly a list of existing penalties and administrative measures applicable in each Member State.

Member States shall provide ESMA annually with aggregate information regarding the penalties and administrative measures imposed. If a competent authority discloses to the public the fact that a penalty or an administrative measure has been imposed, it shall, contemporaneously, notify ESMA thereof.
