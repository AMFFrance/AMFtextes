(1) This Regulation aims to establish a uniform regime for the submission of notifications and information by investors to national competent authorities or by those competent authorities to the European Securities and Markets Authority (hereinafter ‘ESMA’). Since the turnover calculation to determine exempted shares is also closely linked to the giving of information concerning shares where their principal trading venue is in the Union, it should also be covered by this Regulation. To ensure coherence between such provisions, which should enter into force at the same time, and to facilitate a comprehensive view and compact access to them by persons subject to those obligations it is desirable to include all the regulatory technical standards required by Regulation (EU) No 236/2012 in a single Regulation.
