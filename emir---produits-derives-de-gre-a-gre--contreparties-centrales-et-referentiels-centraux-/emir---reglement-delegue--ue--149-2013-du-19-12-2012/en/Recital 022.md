(22) The determination of the value of the clearing thresholds should take into account the systemic relevance of the sum of net positions and exposures per counterparty and per class of OTC derivatives in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. However, it should be considered that these net positions and exposures are different from a net exposure across counterparties and across asset class. Furthermore, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 these net positions should be added up in order to determine the data to be considered for the setting of the clearing thresholds. It is the total gross sum resulting from the addition of these net positions that should be considered when setting the clearing thresholds. The gross notional value resulting from that addition should be used as a reference for setting the clearing thresholds.
