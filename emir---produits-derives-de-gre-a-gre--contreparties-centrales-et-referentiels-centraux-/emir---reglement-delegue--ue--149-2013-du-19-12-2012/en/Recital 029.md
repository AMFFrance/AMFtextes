(29) In view of the different risk profiles and in order for the portfolio reconciliation to be a proportionate risk mitigation technique, the frequency of the reconciliation and size of the portfolio to consider should be different depending on the nature of the counterparties. More demanding requirements should apply to both financial counterparties and non-financial counterparties that exceed the clearing threshold while lower reconciliation frequency should apply for non-financial counterparties that would not exceed the clearing threshold irrespective of the category of its counterparty who would also benefit from this less frequent reconciliation for that part of its portfolio.
