(9) Although all information to be included in the notification from the competent authority to ESMA for the purpose of the clearing obligation may not always be available, especially for new products, estimates that are available should be provided, including a clear indication of the assumptions made. The notification should also contain information pertaining to the counterparties, such as the type and number of counterparties, the steps required to start clearing with a CCP, their legal and operational capacity or their risk management framework in order to allow ESMA to assess the ability of the active counterparties to comply with the clearing obligation without disruption to the market.
