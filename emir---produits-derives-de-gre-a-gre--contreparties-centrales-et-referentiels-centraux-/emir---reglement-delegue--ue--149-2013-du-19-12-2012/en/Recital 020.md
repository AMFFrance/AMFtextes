(20) The range of risks directly related to commercial and treasury financing activities is very wide and varies across different economic sectors. Risks related to commercial activities are typically attached to inputs to the production function of a company as well as products and services that it sells or provides. Treasury financing activities typically relate to the management of the short- and long-term funding of an entity, including its debt, and the ways it invests the financial resources it generates or holds, including cash management. Treasury financing and commercial activities can be affected by common sources of risks, such as foreign exchange, commodity prices, inflation or credit risk. Given that OTC derivatives are concluded to hedge a particular risk, when analysing the risks directly related to commercial or treasury financing activities, those risks should be defined in a consistent manner covering both activities. In addition, separating the two concepts might have unintended consequences, given that depending on the sector in which non-financial counterparties operate, a particular risk would be hedged under treasury financing or commercial activity.
