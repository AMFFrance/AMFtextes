(7) As indirect clearing arrangements may give rise to specific risks, all the parties included in an indirect clearing arrangement, including clearing members and CCPs, should routinely identify, monitor and manage any material risks arising from the arrangement. Appropriate sharing of information between clients that provide indirect clearing services and clearing members that facilitate those services is especially important in this context. Clearing members should use information provided by clients for risk management purposes only and should prevent the misuse of commercially sensitive information, including through the use of effective barriers between different divisions of a financial institution to avoid conflicts of interest.
