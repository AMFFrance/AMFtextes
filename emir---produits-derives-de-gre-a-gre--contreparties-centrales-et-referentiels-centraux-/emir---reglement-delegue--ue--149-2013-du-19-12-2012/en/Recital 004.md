(4) An indirect clearing arrangement should not expose a CCP, clearing member, client or indirect client to additional counterparty risk and the assets and positions of the indirect client should benefit from an appropriate level of protection. It is therefore essential that any type of indirect clearing arrangements comply with minimum conditions for ensuring their safety. To that end, the parties involved in indirect clearing arrangements shall be subject to specific obligations. Such arrangements extend beyond the contractual relationship between indirect clients and the client of a clearing member that provides indirect clearing services.
