(2) In view of the global nature of the over the counter (OTC) derivatives market, this Regulation should take into account the relevant internationally agreed guidelines and recommendations on OTC derivatives market reforms and mandatory clearing as well as the related rules developed in other jurisdictions. In particular the framework for the determination of a clearing obligation takes into account the Mandatory Clearing requirements published by the International Organization of Securities Commissions. This will support, as much as possible, convergence with the approach in other jurisdictions.
