# Article 2 - Structure of indirect clearing arrangements


1.   Where a clearing member is prepared to facilitate indirect clearing, any client of such clearing member shall be permitted to provide indirect clearing services to one or more of its own clients, provided that the client of the clearing member is an authorised credit institution, investment firm or an equivalent third country credit institution or investment firm.

2.   The contractual terms of an indirect clearing arrangement shall be agreed between the client of a clearing member and the indirect client, after consultation with the clearing member on the aspects that can impact the operations of the clearing member. They shall include contractual requirements on the client to honour all obligations of the indirect client towards the clearing member. These requirements shall refer only to transactions arising as part of the indirect clearing arrangement, the scope of which shall be clearly documented in the agreed contracts.
