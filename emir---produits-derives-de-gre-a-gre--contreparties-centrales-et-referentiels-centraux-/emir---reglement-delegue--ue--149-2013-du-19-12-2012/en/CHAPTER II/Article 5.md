# Article 5 - Obligations of clients


1.   A client that provides indirect clearing services shall keep separate records and accounts that enable it to distinguish between its own assets and positions and those held for the account of its indirect clients. It shall offer indirect clients a choice between the alternative account segregation options provided for in Article 4(2) and shall ensure that indirect clients are fully informed of the risks associated with each segregation option. The information provided by the client to indirect clients shall include details of arrangements for transferring positions and accounts to an alternative client.

2.   A client that provides indirect clearing services shall request the clearing member to open a segregated account at the CCP. The account shall be for the exclusive purpose of holding the assets and positions of its indirect clients.

3.   A client shall provide the clearing member with sufficient information to identify, monitor and manage any risks arising from facilitating indirect clearing arrangements. In the event of default of the client, all information held by the client in respect of its indirect clients shall be made immediately available to the clearing member.
