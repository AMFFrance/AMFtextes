# Article 3 - Obligations of CCPs


1.   Indirect clearing arrangements shall not be subject to business practices of the CCP which act as a barrier to their establishment on reasonable commercial terms. At the request of a clearing member, the CCP shall maintain separate records and accounts enabling each client to distinguish in accounts held with the CCP the assets and positions of the client from those held for the accounts of the indirect clients of the client.

2.   A CCP shall identify, monitor and manage any material risks arising from indirect clearing arrangements that could affect the resilience of the CCP.
