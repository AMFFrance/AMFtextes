(6) Indirect clearing arrangements should be established so as to ensure that indirect clients can obtain an equivalent level of protection as direct clients in a default scenario. Following the failure of a clearing member that facilitates an indirect clearing arrangement, indirect clients should be included in the transfer of client positions to an alternative clearing member under the portability requirements established by Articles 39 and 48 of Regulation (EU) NoÂ 648/2012. Appropriate safeguards against client failure should also exist within indirect clearing arrangements and should support transferring indirect client positions to an alternative provider of clearing services.
