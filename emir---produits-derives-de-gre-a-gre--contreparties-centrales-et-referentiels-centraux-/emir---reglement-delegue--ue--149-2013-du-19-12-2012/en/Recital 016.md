(16) According to Article 8(4) of Regulation (EU) NoÂ 648/2012, a request to access a trading venue by a CCP should not require interoperability, and, consequently, this Regulation should not prescribe interoperability as the only way to resolve liquidity fragmentation. However, this Regulation should not preclude CCPs from entering into such an arrangement on a voluntary basis if the necessary conditions for its establishment are fulfilled.
