(1) Regulation (EU) NoÂ 648/2012 establishes, among other matters, prudential requirements for central counterparties (CCPs) to ensure that they are safe and sound and comply at all times with the capital requirements. Given that to a great extent risks stemming from clearing activities are covered by specific financial resources, such capital requirements should ensure that a CCP is at all times adequately capitalised against credit risks, counterparty risks, market risks, operational risks, legal and business risks which are not already covered by those specific financial resources and that it is able to conduct an orderly winding down or restructuring of its operations if necessary.
