(6) A CCP does not have to hold capital for trade exposures and default fund contributions which arise under an interoperability arrangement where the requirements of Articles 52 and 53 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 are fulfilled. However, where these requirements are not fulfilled, links between CCPs might expose them to additional risk if the collateral posted by them is not fully protected and bankruptcy remote or if the default fund contributions are at risk in case a clearing member of the receiving CCP defaults. Therefore, in such cases capital charges should apply to default fund contributions and to trade exposures with other CCPs. In order to avoid contagion effects, the treatment regarding default fund contributions to other CCPs should in general be more conservative than the treatment of credit institution exposures to CCPs. The own resources of a CCP used to contribute to the default fund of another CCP should not be taken into account for the purposes of Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 as they are not invested in accordance with its investment policy. They should also not be double-counted for the purpose of calculating risk weighted exposures stemming from these contributions.
