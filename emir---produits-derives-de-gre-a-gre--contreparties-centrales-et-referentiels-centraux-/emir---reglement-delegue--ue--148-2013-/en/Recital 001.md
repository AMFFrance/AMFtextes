(1) In order to allow flexibility, a counterparty should be able to delegate the reporting of a contract to the other counterparty or to a third party. Counterparties should also be able to agree to delegate reporting to a common third entity including a central counterparty (CCP), the latter submitting one report, including the relevant table of fields, to the trade repository. In these circumstances and in order to ensure data quality, the report should indicate that it is made on behalf of both counterparties and contain the full set of details that would have been reported had the contract been reported separately.
