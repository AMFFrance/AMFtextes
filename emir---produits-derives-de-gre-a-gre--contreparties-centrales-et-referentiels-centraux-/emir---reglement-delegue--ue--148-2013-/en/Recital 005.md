(5) Gathering information on the collateral pertaining to a particular contract is essential to ensuring the proper monitoring of exposures. To enable this, counterparties that collateralise their transactions should report such collateralisation details on a transaction level basis. Where collateral is calculated on the basis of net positions resulting from a set of contracts, and is therefore not posted on a transaction level basis but on a portfolio basis, counterparties should be able to report the portfolio using a unique code or numbering system as determined by the counterparty. That unique code should identify the specific portfolio over which the collateral is exchanged where the counterparty has more than one portfolio and should also ensure that a derivative contract can be linked to a particular portfolio over which collateral is being held.
