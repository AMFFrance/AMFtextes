(7) The time necessary for an orderly winding down is strictly dependent on the clearing services provided by the single CCP and on the market environment in which it operates, especially in the case where another CCP can take on its services. Therefore, the number of months required for winding down should be based on the CCPâ€™s own estimate, subject to the approval of the competent authority. A minimum number of six months needs to be introduced in order to ensure a prudent level of the capital requirements.
