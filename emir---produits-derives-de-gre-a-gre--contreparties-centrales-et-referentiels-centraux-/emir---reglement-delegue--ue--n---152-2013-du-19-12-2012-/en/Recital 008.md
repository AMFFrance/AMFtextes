(8) Business risk refers to the risk a CCP assumes due to its efficiency and potential changes in general business conditions which are likely to impair its financial position as a consequence of decline in its revenues or an increase in its expenses resulting in a loss that must be charged against its capital. Since the level of business risk is highly dependent on the individual situation of each CCP and can be caused by various factors such as inefficient procedures, adverse market environment, ineffective response to technological progress, or poor execution of business strategies, the capital requirement should be based on a CCPâ€™s own estimate subject to the approval of the competent authority. A floor needs to be introduced in order to ensure a prudent level of the capital requirements.
