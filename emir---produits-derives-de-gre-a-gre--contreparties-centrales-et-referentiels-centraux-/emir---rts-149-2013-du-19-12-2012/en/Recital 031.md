(31) Dispute resolution aims at mitigating risks stemming from contracts that are not centrally cleared. When entering into OTC derivative transactions with one another, counterparties should have an agreed framework for resolving any related dispute that may arise. The framework should refer to resolution mechanisms such as third party arbitration or market polling mechanism. The framework intends to avoid unresolved disputes escalating and exposing counterparties to additional risks. Disputes should be identified, managed and appropriately disclosed.
