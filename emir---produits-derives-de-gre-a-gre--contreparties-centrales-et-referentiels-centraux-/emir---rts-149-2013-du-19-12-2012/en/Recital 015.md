(15) To prevent liquidity fragmentation all participants in a trading venue should be able to clear all transactions executed between them. However, it would not be proportionate to require all clearing members of an existing CCP to become also clearing members of any new CCP serving such trading venue. Where there are entities which are clearing members of both CCPs, they may facilitate the transfer and clearing of transactions executed by market participants separately served by the two CCPs, to limit the risk of liquidity fragmentation. Nevertheless, it is important that a request to access a trading venue by a CCP does not fragment liquidity in a manner that would increase the risks to which the existing CCP is exposed.
