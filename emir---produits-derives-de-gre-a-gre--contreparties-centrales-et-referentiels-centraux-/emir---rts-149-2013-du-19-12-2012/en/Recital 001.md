(1) A framework should be provided to encompass rules applicable to the clearing obligation, its application, possible exemptions and risk mitigation techniques to be established when clearing with a central counterparty (CCP) cannot take place. To ensure coherence between those provisions, which should enter into force at the same time, and to facilitate a comprehensive view and efficient access for stakeholders and in particular those subject to the obligations, it is desirable to include most of the regulatory technical standards required under Title II of Regulation (EU) NoÂ 648/2012 in a single Regulation.
