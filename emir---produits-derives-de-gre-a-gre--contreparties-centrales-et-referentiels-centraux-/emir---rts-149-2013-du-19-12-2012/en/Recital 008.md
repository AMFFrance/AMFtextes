(8) When it authorises a CCP to clear a class of OTC derivatives, the competent authority is required to notify the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). This notification should include detailed information which is necessary for ESMA to carry out its assessment process, including information on liquidity and volume of the relevant class of OTC derivatives. Although the information flows from the competent authority to ESMA, it is the CCP having requested the authorisation that should initially provide the required information to the competent authorities which may then complement it.
