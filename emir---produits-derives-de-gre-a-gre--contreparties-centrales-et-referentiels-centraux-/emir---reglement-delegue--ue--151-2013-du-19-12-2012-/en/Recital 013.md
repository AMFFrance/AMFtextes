(13) The access to data should be considered within three aggregation levels. Transaction data should include individual trade details; position data should regard aggregate position data by underlying/product for individual counterparties; and aggregate notional data should correspond to overall positions by underlying/product with no counterparty details. Access to transaction data would also grant access to position level and aggregate data. Access to position data would also grant access to aggregate data, but not transaction level data. Conversely, access to aggregate notional data should be the less granular category and should not enable access to position or transaction level data.
