(69) ESMA should submit annual reports to the Commission assessing the trends and potential risks in the markets covered by this Regulation. Those reports should include at least an assessment of settlement efficiency, internalised settlement, cross-border provision of services, the reasons for the rejection of access rights and any other substantive barriers to competition in post-trade financial services including any barriers arising from the inappropriate use of licensing arrangements, appropriateness of penalties for settlement fails, in particular the need for additional flexibility in relation to penalties for settlement fails in relation to illiquid financial instruments, the application of Member States’ rules on civil liability to losses attributable to CSDs, the conditions relating to the provision of banking-type ancillary services, requirements regarding the protection of securities of participants and those of their clients, and the sanctions regime and may contain, where necessary, recommendations of preventative or remedial actions. ESMA should also conduct peer reviews covering the activities of the competent authorities under this Regulation within an appropriate time-frame and in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. Given the systemic importance of CSDs and the fact that they are being regulated for the first time at Union level, it is appropriate to require that such peer reviews should initially occur every three years at least in relation to the supervision of CSDs which make use of the freedom to provide services or participate in an interoperable link.
