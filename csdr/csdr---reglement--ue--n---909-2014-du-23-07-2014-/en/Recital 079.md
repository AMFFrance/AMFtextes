(79) CSDs should be exempt from the application of Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 where they provide services that are explicitly listed in this Regulation. However, in order to ensure that any entities providing investment services and activities are subject to Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and to avoid competitive distortions between different types of providers of such services, it is necessary to require CSDs that provide investment services and activities in the course of their ancillary services to be subject to the requirements of Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014.
