(40) Conduct of business rules should provide transparency in the relations between CSDs and their users. In particular, CSDs should have publicly disclosed, transparent, objective and non-discriminatory criteria for participation in the securities settlement system, which would allow restriction of access by participants only on the basis of the risks involved. A quick and appropriate remedy should be made available to competent authorities to address any unjustified refusal of CSDs to provide their services to participants. CSDs should publicly disclose prices and fees for their services. In order to provide open and non-discriminatory access to their services and in view of the significant market power that CSDs still enjoy in the territory of their respective Member States, CSDs should not be able to diverge from their published pricing policy for their core services and should maintain separate accounts for the costs and revenues associated with each of their core services and with their ancillary services. Those participation provisions complement and reinforce the right of market participants to use a settlement system in another Member State provided for in Directive 2014/65/EU.
