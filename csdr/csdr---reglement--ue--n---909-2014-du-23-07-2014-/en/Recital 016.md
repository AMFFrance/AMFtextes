(16) The procedures and penalties relating to settlement fails should be commensurate with the scale and seriousness of such fails whilst being scaled in such a way that maintains and protects the liquidity of the relevant financial instruments. In particular, market-making activities play a crucial role in providing liquidity to markets within the Union, particularly to less liquid securities. Measures to prevent and address settlement fails should be balanced against the need to maintain and protect liquidity in those securities. Cash penalties imposed on failing participants should, where possible, be credited to the non-failing clients as compensation and should not, in any event, become a source of revenue for the CSD concerned. CSDs should consult the market infrastructures in respect of which they provide CSD services on the implementation of settlement discipline measures laid down in this Regulation.
