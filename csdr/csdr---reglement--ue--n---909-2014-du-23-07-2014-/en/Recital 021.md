(21) Taking into account that CSDs should be subject to common requirements and in order to dismantle the existing barriers to cross-border settlement, any authorised CSDs should enjoy the freedom to provide services within the territory of the Union, including through setting up a branch. In order to ensure an appropriate level of safety in the provision of services by CSDs in another Member State, such CSDs should be subject to a specific procedure laid down in this Regulation where they intend to provide certain core services as provided for in this Regulation or set up a branch in a host Member State.
