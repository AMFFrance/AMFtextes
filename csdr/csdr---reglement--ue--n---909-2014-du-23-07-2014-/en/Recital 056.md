(56) In many Member States issuers are required by national law to issue certain types of securities, notably shares, within their national CSDs. In order to remove this barrier to the smooth functioning of the Union post-trading market and to allow issuers to opt for the most efficient way of managing their securities, issuers should have the right to choose any CSD established in the Union for recording their securities and receiving any relevant CSD services. Since harmonisation of national corporate law is beyond the scope of this Regulation, such national corporate or similar law under which the securities are constituted should continue to apply and arrangements be made to ensure that the requirements of such national corporate or similar law can be met where the right of choice of CSD is exercised. Such national corporate and similar law under which the securities are constituted govern the relationship between their issuer and holders or any third parties, and their respective rights and duties attached to the securities such as voting rights, dividends and corporate actions. A refusal to provide services to an issuer should be permissible only based on a comprehensive risk assessment or if that CSD does not provide any issuance services in relation to securities constituted under the corporate or similar law of the relevant Member State. A quick and appropriate remedy should be made available to competent authorities to address any unjustified refusal of CSDs to provide their services to issuers.
