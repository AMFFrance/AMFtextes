(47) Since Directive 2013/36/EU does not specifically address intra-day credit and liquidity risks resulting from the provision of banking services ancillary to settlement, credit institutions and CSDs providing such services should also be subject to specific enhanced credit and liquidity risk mitigation requirements, including a risk-based capital surcharge which reflects the relevant risks. Such enhanced credit and liquidity risk mitigation requirements should follow the global standards for financial market infrastructures and the principles for ‘Monitoring tools for intra-day liquidity management’ published in April 2013 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.
