(37) Transparent governance rules should ensure that the interests of the shareholders, the management and staff of the CSD, on the one hand, and the interests of their users whom CSDs are ultimately serving, on the other, are taken into account. Those governance rules should apply without prejudice to the ownership model adopted by the CSD. User committees should be established for each securities settlement system operated by the CSD to give users the opportunity to advise the management body of the CSD on the key issues that impact them and should be given the tools to perform their role. The interests of different users of CSDs, including those of holders of different types of securities, should be represented in the user committee.
