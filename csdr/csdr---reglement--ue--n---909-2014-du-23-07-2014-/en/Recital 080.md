(80) The application of the authorisation and recognition requirements of this Regulation should be deferred in order to provide CSDs established in the Union or in third countries with sufficient time to apply for authorisation and recognition of their activities provided for in this Regulation. Until a decision is made under this Regulation on the authorisation or recognition of CSDs and of their activities, including CSD links, the respective national rules on authorisation and recognition of CSDs should continue to apply.
