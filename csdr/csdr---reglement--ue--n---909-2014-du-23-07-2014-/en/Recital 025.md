(25) This Regulation should not prevent Member States from requiring in their national law a specific legal framework for day-to-day cooperation at national level between the competent authority of the CSD and relevant authorities. Such a national legal framework should be consistent with the guidelines concerning supervisory practices and cooperation between authorities that ESMA may issue under this Regulation.
