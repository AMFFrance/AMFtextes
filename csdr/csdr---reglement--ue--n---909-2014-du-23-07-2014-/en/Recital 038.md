(38) CSDs should be able to outsource the operation of their services provided that the risks arising from such outsourcing arrangements are managed. Taking into account the significance of the tasks entrusted to CSDs, this Regulation should provide that CSDs do not transfer their responsibilities to third parties through the outsourcing by contract of their activities to third parties. Outsourcing of such activities should be subject to strict conditions that maintain the responsibility of CSDs for their activities and ensure that the supervision and oversight of the CSDs are not impaired. It should be possible to exempt outsourcing by a CSD of its activities to a public entity from those requirements under certain conditions.
