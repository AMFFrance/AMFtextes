(48) Some CSDs also operating as credit institutions are subject to own funds and reporting requirements relevant for credit institutions and laid down in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15) and in Directive 2013/36/EU. Given the systemic importance of such CSDs it is appropriate that the strictest requirements provided in Union law apply in order to avoid the cumulative application of various Union rules, for example in relation to the reporting of own funds requirements. In any areas where potential duplication of requirements is identified, the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (‘EBA’) established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16) and ESMA should provide an opinion on the appropriate application of the Union acts in accordance with Article 34 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 and of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.
