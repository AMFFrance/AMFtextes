(46) In order to secure efficiencies resulting from the provision of both CSD and banking services within the same group of undertakings, the requirements of this Regulation should not prevent credit institutions from belonging to the same group of undertakings as the CSD. It is appropriate to provide for arrangements under which CSDs could be authorised to provide to their participants and to other entities ancillary services from within the same legal entity or from within a separate legal entity which may be part of the same group of undertakings ultimately controlled by the same parent undertaking or not. Where a credit institution other than a central bank acts as a settlement agent, the credit institution should be able to provide to the CSD participants the services set out in this Regulation, which are covered by the authorisation, but should not provide other banking services from the same legal entity in order to limit the settlement systemâ€™s exposure to the risks resulting from the failure of the credit institution.
