(20) As the main purpose of this Regulation is to introduce a number of legal obligations imposed directly on market operators consisting, inter alia, of the recording in book-entry form in CSDs of all transferable securities once such securities are traded on trading venues regulated by Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) NoÂ 600/2014 or provided as collateral under the conditions of Directive 2002/47/EC and in the settling of their obligations no later than on the second business day after trading takes place and as CSDs are responsible for the operation of securities settlement systems and the application of measures to provide timely settlement in the Union, it is essential to ensure that all CSDs are safe and sound and comply at all times with stringent organisational, conduct of business and prudential requirements laid down in this Regulation, including by taking all reasonable steps to mitigate fraud and negligence. Uniform and directly applicable rules regarding the authorisation and ongoing supervision of CSDs are therefore an essential corollary of and are interrelated with the legal obligations imposed on market participants by this Regulation. It is, therefore, necessary to include rules regarding the authorisation and supervision of CSDs in the same act as the legal obligations imposed on market participants.
