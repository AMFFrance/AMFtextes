(23) Where a CSD provides its services in another Member State, the competent authority of the host Member State should be able to request from the competent authority of the home Member State all information concerning the activities of the CSD that is of relevance to the requesting authority. In order to enable effective coordination of supervision, that information could concern in particular the services provided to CSD users established in the host Member State or the instruments or currencies processed and may include information on adverse developments, results of risk assessments and remedial measures. The competent authority of the home Member State should also have access to any information periodically reported by the CSD to the competent authority of the host Member State.
