(60) A quick and appropriate remedy should be made available to competent authorities to address any unjustified refusal of CSDs or market infrastructures to provide access to their services. This Regulation completes the access arrangements between trading venues, CCPs, and CSDs as laid down in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 necessary to establish a competitive internal market in post-trade services. ESMA and the Commission should continue to monitor closely the evolution of post-trade infrastructure and the Commission should, where necessary, intervene in order to prevent competitive distortions from occurring in the internal market.
