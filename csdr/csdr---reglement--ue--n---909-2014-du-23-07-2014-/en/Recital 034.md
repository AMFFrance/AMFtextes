(34) CSDs established in third countries should be able to offer their services in the Union, including through the setting-up of a branch. In order to ensure an appropriate level of safety in the provision of CSD services by third-country CSDs, such CSDs should be subject to recognition by ESMA where they intend to provide certain services listed in this Regulation or to set up a branch in the Union. Third-country CSDs should be able to set up links with CSDs established in the Union in the absence of such recognition provided that the relevant competent authority does not object. In view of the global nature of financial markets, ESMA is best placed to recognise third-country CSDs. ESMA should be able to recognise third-country CSDs only if the Commission concludes that they are subject to a legal and supervisory framework effectively equivalent to the one provided in this Regulation, if they are effectively authorised, supervised and subject to oversight in their country of establishment and cooperation arrangements have been established between ESMA, the competent authorities and relevant authorities of CSDs. Recognition by ESMA should be subject to an effective equivalent recognition of the prudential framework applicable to CSDs established in the Union and authorised under this Regulation.
