(28) In order to provide reliable data on the scale of securities settlement outside securities settlement systems and to ensure that the risks arising can be monitored and addressed, any institutions other than CSDs that settle securities transactions outside a securities settlement system should report their settlement activities to the competent authorities concerned. The recipient competent authorities should subsequently transmit that information to ESMA and should inform ESMA of any potential risk resulting from such settlement activities. Furthermore, ESMA should monitor such settlement activities and take into account the potential risks that they might create.
