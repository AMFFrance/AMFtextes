(10) Financial instruments other than shares and debt instruments that fall within the scope of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, such as depository receipts, emission allowances and exchange-traded funds, do not usually have a highly standardised settlement and liquid markets. They are also often traded over-the-counter (OTC). In view of the limited volume and size of transactions and in order to reflect their non-standardised trading and settlement, settlement fails should be subject to a similar penalty rate to the one for shares that do not have a liquid market.
