(3) To ensure that cash penalties imposed on failing participants act as an effective deterrent, the parameters for the calculation of the level of cash penalties should be closely related to the value of financial instruments that fail to be delivered, and to which appropriate penalty rates should be applied. The value of the financial instruments underlying the transaction should also be the basis for the calculation of the level of cash penalty where the settlement fail is due to a lack of cash. The level of cash penalties should provide incentives to failing participants to promptly settle transactions that failed to be settled. In order to ensure the effective achievement of the objectives pursued by the imposition of cash penalties, the adequacy of the parameters for their calculation should be monitored on an ongoing basis and adjusted, as necessary, on the basis of the impact of those penalties on the market.
