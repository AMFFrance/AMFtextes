(11) The parameters for calculating cash penalties should be adapted to the specificities of certain trading venues, such as SME growth markets as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (2). Cash penalties for settlement fails should not hinder access by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to capital markets as an alternative to bank lending. In addition, Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 allows SME growth markets the flexibility not to apply the buy-in process to settlement fails until up to 15 days after the intended settlement date. Consequently, cash penalties for settlement fails in financial instruments traded on SME growth markets may apply during a longer period of time than for other financial instruments. Given the length of application of cash penalties, lower liquidity and specificities of SME growth markets, the penalty rate for settlement fails of transactions in financial instruments traded on such trading venues should be set at a specific rate that should provide incentives for timely settlement but should not affect their smooth and orderly functioning. It is also appropriate to ensure that settlement fails of transactions in certain financial instruments, such as debt instruments traded on such venues, are subject to a lower penalty rate than similar debt instruments traded on other markets.
