(48) Collective investment undertakings falling within the scope of this Directive should not be used for purposes other than the collective investment of the capital raised from the public according to the rules laid down in this Directive. In the cases identified by this Directive, it should be possible for a UCITS to have subsidiaries only when necessary to pursue effectively, on its own behalf, certain activities, also defined in this Directive. It is necessary to ensure effective supervision of UCITS. The establishment of a subsidiary of a UCITS in a third country should therefore be permitted only in the cases identified and in accordance with the conditions laid down in this Directive. The general obligation to act solely in the interests of unit-holders and, in particular, the objective of increasing cost efficiencies, never justify a UCITS undertaking measures that could hinder the competent authorities from effectively exercising their supervisory functions.
