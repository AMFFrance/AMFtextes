(5) The coordination of the laws of the Member States should be confined to UCITS other than of the closed-ended type that promote the sale of their units to the public in the Community. It is desirable that UCITS be permitted, as part of their investment objective, to invest in financial instruments, other than transferable securities, which are sufficiently liquid. The financial instruments which are eligible to be investment assets of the portfolio of the UCITS should be listed in this Directive. The selection of investments for a portfolio by means of an index is a management technique.
