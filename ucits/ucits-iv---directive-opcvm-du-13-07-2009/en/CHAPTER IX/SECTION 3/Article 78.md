# Article 78 - null


1.   Member States shall require that an investment company and, for each of the common funds it manages, a management company draw up a short document containing key information for investors. That document shall be referred to as ‘key investor information’ in this Directive. The words ‘key investor information’ shall be clearly stated in that document, in one of the languages referred to in Article 94(1)(b).

2.   Key investor information shall include appropriate information about the essential characteristics of the UCITS concerned, which is to be provided to investors so that they are reasonably able to understand the nature and the risks of the investment product that is being offered to them and, consequently, to take investment decisions on an informed basis.

3.   Key investor information shall provide information on the following essential elements in respect of the UCITS concerned:

(a) identification of the UCITS;

(b) a short description of its investment objectives and investment policy;

(c) past-performance presentation or, where relevant, performance scenarios;

(d) costs and associated charges; and

(e) risk/reward profile of the investment, including appropriate guidance and warnings in relation to the risks associated with investments in the relevant UCITS.

Those essential elements shall be comprehensible to the investor without any reference to other documents.

4.   Key investor information shall clearly specify where and how to obtain additional information relating to the proposed investment, including but not limited to where and how the prospectus and the annual and half-yearly report can be obtained on request and free of charge at any time, and the language in which such information is available to investors.

5.   Key investor information shall be written in a concise manner and in non-technical language. It shall be drawn up in a common format, allowing for comparison, and shall be presented in a way that is likely to be understood by retail investors.

6.   Key investor information shall be used without alterations or supplements, except translation, in all Member States where the UCITS is notified to market its units in accordance with Article 93.

7.   The Commission shall adopt implementing measures which define the following:

(a) the detailed and exhaustive content of the key investor information to be provided to investors as referred to in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4;

(b) the detailed and exhaustive content of the key investor information to be provided to investors in the following specific cases: (i) for UCITS having different investment compartments, the key investor information to be provided to investors subscribing to a specific investment compartment, including how to pass from one investment compartment into another and the costs related thereto; (ii) for UCITS offering different share classes, the key investor information to be provided to investors subscribing to a specific share class; (iii) for fund of funds structures, the key investor information to be provided to investors subscribing to a UCITS, which invests itself in other UCITS or other collective investment undertakings referred to in Article 50(1)(e); (iv) for master-feeder structures, the key investor information to be provided to investors subscribing to a feeder UCITS; and (v) for structured, capital protected and other comparable UCITS, the key investor information to be provided to investors in relation to the special characteristics of such UCITS; and

(c) the specific details of the format and presentation of the key investor information to be provided to investors as referred to in paragraph 5.

Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 112(2).
