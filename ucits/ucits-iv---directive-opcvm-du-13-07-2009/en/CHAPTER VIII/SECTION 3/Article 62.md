# Article 62 - null


1.   Member States shall require that if the master and the feeder UCITS have different auditors, those auditors enter into an information-sharing agreement in order to ensure the fulfilment of the duties of both auditors, including the arrangements taken to comply with the requirements of paragraph 2.

The feeder UCITS shall not invest in units of the master UCITS until such agreement has become effective.

2.   In its audit report, the auditor of the feeder UCITS shall take into account the audit report of the master UCITS. If the feeder and the master UCITS have different accounting years, the auditor of the master UCITS shall make an ad hoc report on the closing date of the feeder UCITS.

The auditor of the feeder UCITS shall, in particular, report on any irregularities revealed in the audit report of the master UCITS and on their impact on the feeder UCITS.

3.   Where they comply with the requirements laid down in this Chapter, neither the auditor of the master UCITS nor that of the feeder UCITS shall be found to be in breach of any rules that restrict the disclosure of information or relate to data protection where such rules are provided for in a contract or in a law, regulation or administrative provision. Such compliance shall not give rise to any liability on the part of such auditor or any person acting on its behalf.

4.   The Commission may adopt implementing measures specifying the content of the agreement referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1.

Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 112(2).
