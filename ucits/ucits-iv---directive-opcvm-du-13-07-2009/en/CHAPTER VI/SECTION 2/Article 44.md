# Article 44 - null


Where the national laws of Member States require approval by the unit-holders of mergers between UCITS, Member States shall ensure that such approval does not require more than 75 % of the votes actually cast by unit-holders present or represented at the general meeting of unit-holders.

The first paragraph shall be without prejudice to any presence quorum provided for under national laws. Member States shall impose neither more stringent presence quorums for cross-border than for domestic mergers nor more stringent presence quorums for UCITS mergers than for mergers of corporate entities.
