(18) The principle of home Member State supervision requires that the competent authorities withdraw or refuse to grant authorisation where factors, such as the content of programmes of operations, the geographical distribution or the activities in fact pursued indicate clearly that a management company has opted for the legal system of one Member State for the purpose of evading the stricter standards in force in another Member State within the territory of which it intends to pursue or does pursue the greater part of its activities. For the purposes of this Directive, a management company should be authorised in the Member State in which it has its registered office. In accordance with the principle of home Member State supervision, only the competent authorities of the management company’s home Member State should be considered competent to supervise the organisation of the management company, including all procedures and resources to perform the function of administration referred to in Annex II, which should be subject to the law of the management company’s home Member State.
