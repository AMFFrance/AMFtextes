(12) With regard to collective portfolio management (management of unit trusts/common funds or investment companies), the authorisation granted to a management company in its home Member State should permit the company to pursue in host Member States the following activities, without prejudice to Chapter XI: to distribute, through the establishment of a branch, the units of the harmonised unit trusts/common funds managed by that company in its home Member State; to distribute, through the establishment of a branch, the shares of the harmonised investment companies, managed by that company; to distribute the units of the harmonised unit trusts/common funds or shares of the harmonised investment companies managed by other management companies; to perform all the other functions and tasks included in the activity of collective portfolio management; to manage the assets of investment companies incorporated in Member States other than its home Member State; to perform, on the basis of mandates, on behalf of management companies incorporated in Member States other than its home Member State, the functions included in the activity of collective portfolio management. Where a management company distributes the units of its own harmonised unit trusts/common funds or shares of its own harmonised investment companies in host Member States, without the establishment of a branch, it should be subject only to rules regarding cross-border marketing.
