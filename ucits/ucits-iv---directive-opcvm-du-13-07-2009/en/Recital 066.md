(66) To facilitate access of UCITS to the markets of other Member States, the UCITS should be required to translate only the key investor information into the official language or one of the official languages of a UCITS host Member State or a language approved by its competent authorities. Key investor information should specify the language(s) in which other obligatory disclosure documents and additional information are available. Translations should be produced under the responsibility of the UCITS, which should decide whether a simple or a sworn translation is necessary.
