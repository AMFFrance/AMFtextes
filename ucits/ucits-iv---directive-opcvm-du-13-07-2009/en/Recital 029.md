(29) In order to safeguard investorsâ€™ interests, Member States should require proposed domestic or cross-border mergers between UCITS to be subject to authorisation by their competent authorities. For cross-border mergers, the competent authorities of the merging UCITS should authorise the merger so as to ensure that the interests of the unit-holders who effectively change UCITS are duly protected. If the merger involves more than one merging UCITS and such UCITS are domiciled in different Member States, the competent authorities of each merging UCITS will need to authorise the merger, in close cooperation with each other, including through appropriate information-sharing. Since the interests of the unit-holders of the receiving UCITS also need to be adequately safeguarded, they should be taken into account by the competent authorities of the receiving UCITS home Member State.
