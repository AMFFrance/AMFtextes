(49) The original version of Directive 85/611/EEC contained a derogation from the restriction on the percentage of its assets that a UCITS can invest in transferable securities issued by the same body, which applied in the case of bonds issued or guaranteed by a Member State. That derogation allowed UCITS to invest, in particular, up to 35 % of their assets in such bonds. A similar but more limited derogation is justified with regard to private sector bonds which, even in the absence of a State guarantee, offer special guarantees to the investor under the specific rules applicable thereto. It is necessary, therefore, to extend the derogation to the totality of private sector bonds which fulfil jointly fixed criteria, while leaving it to the Member States to draw up the list of bonds to which they intend, where appropriate, to grant a derogation.
