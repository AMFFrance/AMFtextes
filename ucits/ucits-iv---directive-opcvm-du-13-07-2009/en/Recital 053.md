(53) In order to allow the feeder UCITS to act in the best interests of its unit-holders and notably place it in a position to obtain from the master UCITS all information and documents necessary to perform its obligations, the feeder and the master UCITS should enter into a binding and enforceable agreement. If both feeder and master UCITS are managed by the same management company, however, it should be sufficient that the latter establish internal conduct of business rules. Information-sharing agreements between the depositaries or the auditors respectively of the feeder UCITS and the master UCITS should ensure the flow of information and documents that is needed for the feeder UCITSâ€™ depositary or auditor to fulfil its duties. This Directive should ensure that, when complying with those requirements, the depositaries or the auditors are not to be found in breach of any restriction on disclosure of information or of data protection.
