(85) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt the following implementing measures. As regards management companies, the Commission should be empowered to adopt measures specifying the details of organisational requirements, risk management, conflicts of interest and rules of conduct. As regards depositaries, the Commission should be empowered to adopt measures specifying the measures to be taken by depositaries in order to fulfil their duties in regard to UCITS managed by a management company, established in a Member State other than the UCITS home Member State and the particulars of the agreement between the depositary and the management company. Those implementing measures should facilitate a uniform application of the obligations of management companies and depositaries but should not be a precondition for implementing the right of management companies to pursue the activities for which they have been authorised in their home Member State throughout the Community by establishing branches or under the freedom to provide services including the management of UCITS in another Member State.
