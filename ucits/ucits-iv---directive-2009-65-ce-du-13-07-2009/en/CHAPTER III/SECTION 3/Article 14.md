# Article 14 - null


1.   Each Member State shall draw up rules of conduct which management companies authorised in that Member State shall observe at all times. Such rules shall implement at least the principles set out in this paragraph. Those principles shall ensure that a management company:

(a) acts honestly and fairly in conducting its business activities in the best interests of the UCITS it manages and the integrity of the market;

(b) acts with due skill, care and diligence, in the best interests of the UCITS it manages and the integrity of the market;

(c) has and employs effectively the resources and procedures that are necessary for the proper performance of its business activities;

(d) tries to avoid conflicts of interests and, when they cannot be avoided, ensures that the UCITS it manages are fairly treated; and

(e) complies with all regulatory requirements applicable to the conduct of its business activities so as to promote the best interests of its investors and the integrity of the market.

2.   Without prejudice to Article 116, the Commission shall adopt, by 1 July 2010, implementing measures, with a view to ensuring that the management company complies with the duties set out in paragraph 1, in particular to:

(a) establish appropriate criteria for acting honestly and fairly and with due skill, care and diligence in the best interests of the UCITS;

(b) specify the principles required to ensure that management companies employ effectively the resources and procedures that are necessary for the proper performance of their business activities; and

(c) define the steps that management companies might reasonably be expected to take to identify, prevent, manage or disclose conflicts of interest as well as to establish appropriate criteria for determining the types of conflicts of interest whose existence may damage the interests of the UCITS.

Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 112(2).
