(35) The definition of transferable securities included in this Directive applies only for the purposes of this Directive and does not affect the various definitions used in national legislation for other purposes such as taxation. Consequently, shares and other securities equivalent to shares issued by bodies such as building societies and industrial and provident societies, the ownership of which cannot, in practice, be transferred except by the issuing body buying them back, are not covered by this definition.
