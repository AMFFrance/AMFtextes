(10) The notification from the competent authority to ESMA should contain information on the degree of standardisation, liquidity and price availability, in order for ESMA to assess whether a class of OTC derivatives should be subject to the clearing obligation. The criteria related to the standardisation of the contractual terms and operational processes of a relevant class of OTC are an indicator of the standardisation of the economic terms of a class of OTC derivatives as it is only when such economic terms are standardised that the contractual terms and operational processes can be standardised. The criteria related to liquidity and price availability are assessed by ESMA with different considerations than the assessment made by the competent authority while authorising the CCP. Liquidity in this context is assessed on a wider perspective and differs from the liquidity after the clearing obligation would apply. In particular, the fact that a contract is sufficiently liquid to be cleared by one CCP does not necessarily imply that it should be subject to the clearing obligation. ESMAâ€™s assessment should not replicate or duplicate the review already performed by the competent authority.
