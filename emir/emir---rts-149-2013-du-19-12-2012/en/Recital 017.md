(17) In order to establish which OTC derivative contracts are objectively measurable as reducing risks directly relating to commercial activity or treasury financing activity, non-financial counterparties should apply one of the criteria provided for in this Regulation including the accounting definition based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) rules. The accounting definition can be used by counterparties even though they do not apply IFRS rules. For those non-financial counterparties that may use local accounting rules, it is expected that most of the contracts classified as hedging under such local accounting rules would fall within the general definition of contracts reducing risks directly related to commercial activity or treasury financing activity provided for in this Regulation.
