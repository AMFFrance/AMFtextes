# Article 4 - Obligations of clearing members


1.   A clearing member that offers to facilitate indirect clearing services shall do so on reasonable commercial terms. Without prejudice to the confidentiality of contractual arrangements with individual clients, the clearing member shall publicly disclose the general terms on which it is prepared to facilitate indirect clearing services. These terms may include minimum operational requirements for clients that provide indirect clearing services.

2.   When facilitating indirect clearing arrangements, a clearing member shall implement any of the following segregation arrangements as indicated by the client:

(a) keep separate records and accounts enabling each client to distinguish in accounts with the clearing member the assets and positions of the client from those held for the accounts of its indirect clients;

(b) keep separate records and accounts enabling each client to distinguish in accounts with the clearing member the assets and positions held for the account of an indirect client from those held for the account of other indirect clients.

3.   The requirement to distinguish assets and positions with the clearing member shall be considered to be met if the conditions specified in Article 39(9) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 are satisfied.

4.   A clearing member shall establish robust procedures to manage the default of a client that provides indirect clearing services. These procedures shall include a credible mechanism for transferring the positions and assets to an alternative client or clearing member, subject to the agreement of the indirect clients affected. A client or clearing member shall not be obliged to accept these positions unless it has entered into a prior contractual agreement to do so.

5.   The clearing member shall also ensure that its procedures allow for the prompt liquidation of the assets and positions of indirect clients and the clearing member to pay all monies due to the indirect clients following the default of the client.

6.   A clearing member shall identify, monitor and manage any risks arising from facilitating indirect clearing arrangements, including using information provided by clients under Article 4(3). The clearing member shall establish robust internal procedures to ensure this information cannot be used for commercial purposes.
