(4) For CCPs that during the day do not allocate the trades to each client, the reduction of the minimum liquidation period from two days to one day might imply that for new trades cleared during the day and not allocated to individual clients the CCP is margining them on a one-day net basis. This may expose the CCP to significant losses in case of intraday price movements that do not trigger the call of intraday margins. Therefore, a specific threshold needs to be set to ensure that CCPs call intraday margins and remain sufficiently protected notwithstanding the reduction of the liquidation period.
