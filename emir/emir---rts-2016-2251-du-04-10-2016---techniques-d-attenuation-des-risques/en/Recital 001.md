(1) Counterparties have an obligation to protect themselves against credit exposures to derivatives counterparties by collecting margins where those contracts are not cleared by a central counterparty. This Regulation lays out the standards for the timely, accurate and appropriately segregated exchange of collateral. These standards should apply on a mandatory basis to the collateral that counterparties are required to collect or post pursuant to this Regulation. However, counterparties which agree to collecting or posting collateral beyond the requirements of this Regulation should be able to choose whether or not to exchange such collateral in accordance with these standards.
