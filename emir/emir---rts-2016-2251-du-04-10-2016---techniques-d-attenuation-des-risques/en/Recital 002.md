(2) Counterparties subject to the requirements of Article 11(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 should take into account the different risk profiles of non-financial counterparties that are below the clearing threshold referred to in Article 10 of that Regulation when establishing their risk management procedures for over-the-counter (‘OTC’) derivative contracts concluded with such entities. It is therefore appropriate to allow counterparties to determine whether or not the level of counterparty credit risk posed by those non-financial counterparties that is below that clearing threshold needs to be mitigated through the exchange of collateral. Given that non-financial counterparties established in a third country that would be below the clearing threshold if established in the Union can be assumed to have the same risk profiles as non-financial counterparties below the clearing threshold established in the Union, the same approach should be applied to both types of entities in order to prevent regulatory arbitrage.
