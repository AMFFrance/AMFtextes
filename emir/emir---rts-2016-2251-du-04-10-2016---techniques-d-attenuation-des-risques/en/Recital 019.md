(19) In order to safeguard against the case where collateral cannot be liquidated immediately after the default of a counterparty, it is necessary, when calculating initial margin to take into account the time period from the most recent exchange of collateral covering a netting set of contracts with a defaulting counterparty until the contracts are closed out and the resulting market risk is re-hedged. This time period is known as the ‘margin period of risk’ (‘MPOR’) and is the same tool as that used in Article 272(9) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), with respect to counterparty credit risk of credit institutions. Nevertheless, as the objectives of the two Regulations differ, and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 sets out rules for calculating the MPOR for the purpose of own funds requirements only, this Regulation should include specific rules on the MPOR that are required in the context of the risk management procedures for non-centrally cleared OTC derivative contracts. The MPOR should take into account the processes required by this Regulation for the exchange of margins.
