(15) Exposures arising either from contracts or counterparties that are permanently or temporarily exempted or partially exempted from margins, should also be included in the calculation of the aggregated gross notional amount. This is due to the fact that all the contracts contribute to the determination of the size and complexity of a counterparty's portfolio. Therefore, non-centrally cleared OTC derivative contracts that may be exempted from the requirements of this Regulation are also relevant for determining the size, scale and complexity of the counterparty's portfolio and should therefore also be included in the calculation of the thresholds.
