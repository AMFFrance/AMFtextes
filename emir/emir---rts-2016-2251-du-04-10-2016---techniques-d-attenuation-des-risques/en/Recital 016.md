(16) It is appropriate to set out special risk management procedures for certain types of non-centrally cleared OTC derivative contracts that show particular risk profiles. In particular, the exchange of variation margin without initial margin should, consistent with the BCBS-IOSCO framework, be considered an appropriate exchange of collateral for physically-settled foreign exchange contracts. Similarly, as cross-currency swaps can be decomposed into a sequence of foreign exchange forwards, only the interest rate component should be covered by initial margin.
