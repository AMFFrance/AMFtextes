(41) Taking into account the principle of proportionality, counterparties that have smaller portfolios and therefore generally smaller operations should be allowed more time to adapt their internal systems and processes in order to comply with the requirements of this Regulation. In order to achieve a proper balance between mitigating the risks arising from non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives and the proportionate application of this Regulation, as well as to achieve international consistency and minimise possibilities of regulatory arbitrage with the view to avoiding market disruption, a phase-in period of the requirements is necessary. The phase-in period for the requirements introduced in this Regulation takes into account the schedule agreed in the BCBS-IOSCO framework, which was established by reference to a quantitative impact study involving Union credit institutions.
