(24) The collecting counterparty should have the operational capability to liquidate the collateral in the case of a default of the poster of collateral. The collecting counterparty should also be able to use the cash proceeds of liquidation to enter into an equivalent contract with another counterparty or to hedge the resulting risk. Having access to the market should therefore be a pre-requisite for the collector of collateral to enable it to either sell the collateral or repo it within a reasonable amount of time. This capability should be independent of the poster of collateral.
