(5) For non-centrally cleared OTC derivative contracts that involve the payment of a premium upfront to guarantee the performance of the contract, the counterparty receiving the payment of the premium (‘option seller’) does not have a current or potential future exposure to the counterparty. Also, the daily mark-to-market value of such contracts is already covered by the payment of this premium. Therefore, where the netting set consists of such option positions, the option seller should be able to choose not to collect initial or variation margins for these types of OTC derivatives as long as the option seller is not exposed to any credit risk. The counterparty paying the premium (‘option buyer’) should however collect both initial and variation margins.
