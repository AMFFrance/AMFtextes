(30) The value of collateral should not exhibit a significant positive correlation with the creditworthiness of the poster of collateral or the value of the underlying non-centrally cleared derivatives portfolio since this would undermine the effectiveness of the protection offered by the collateral collected. Accordingly, securities issued by the poster of collateral or its related entities should not be accepted as collateral. Counterparties should also be required to monitor that collateral collected is not subject to other forms of wrong way risk.
