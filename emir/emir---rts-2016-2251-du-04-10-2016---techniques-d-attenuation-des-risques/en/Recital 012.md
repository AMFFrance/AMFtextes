(12) When setting the level of initial margin requirements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions have explicitly considered two aspects, as reflected in their framework, ‘Margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives’ of March 2015 (‘BCBS-IOSCO framework’). The first aspect is the availability of high credit quality and liquid assets covering the initial margin requirements. The second is the proportionality principle, as smaller financial and non-financial counterparties might be hit in a disproportionate manner from the initial margin requirements. In order to maintain a level playing field, this Regulation should introduce a threshold that is exactly the same as in the BCBS-IOSCO framework below which two counterparties are not required to exchange initial margin. This should substantially alleviate costs and operational burden for smaller participants and address the concern about the availability of high credit quality and liquid assets without undermining the general objectives of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.
