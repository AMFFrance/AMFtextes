(10) Some third-country jurisdictions may determine a different scope to Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 for the purposes of their requirements for the exchange of collateral in relation to OTC derivative contracts that are not centrally cleared. Therefore, were this Regulation to require that only non-centrally cleared OTC derivative contracts governed by Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 are included in the margin calculations for cross-border netting sets, counterparties in different jurisdictions would potentially have to duplicate required calculations to take into account different definitions or different scopes of products under the respective margin requirements. This could lead to distorted margin calculations. Furthermore, this would likely increase the risk of disputes. Therefore, allowing the use of a broader set of products in cross-border netting sets that includes all the OTC derivative contracts that are subject to exchange of collateral in one or the other jurisdiction would facilitate a smoother process of margin collection. This approach is consistent with the systemic risk-reduction goal of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, since a broader range of products would be subject to the margin requirements.
