(23) Collateral should be considered as being freely transferable if, in the case of a default of the poster of collateral, there are no regulatory or legal impediments or third-party claims, including those of the third-party custodian. However, certain claims, such as costs and expenses incurred for the transfer of the collateral, in the form of liens routinely imposed on all securities transfers, should not be considered an impediment as that would lead to a situation where an impediment would always be identified.
