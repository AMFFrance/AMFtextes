(11) Counterparties may choose to collect initial margins in cash, in which case the collateral should not be subject to any haircut, provided that the currency of the collateral matches the currency in which the contract is expressed. However, where initial margins are collected in cash in a currency different than the currency in which the contract is expressed, currency mismatch may generate foreign exchange risk. For this reason, a currency mismatch haircut should apply to initial margins collected in cash in another currency. For variation margins collected in cash no haircut is necessary in line with the BCBS-IOSCO framework, even where the payment is executed in a different currency than the currency of the contract.
