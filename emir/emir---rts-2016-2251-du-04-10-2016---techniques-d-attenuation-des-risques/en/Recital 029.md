(29) Difficulties in segregating cash collateral should be acknowledged by allowing counterparties to post a limited amount of initial margin in the form of cash and by allowing custodians to reinvest this cash collateral. However, cash held by a custodian is a liability that the custodian has towards the posting counterparty, which generates a credit risk for the posting counterparty. Therefore, in order to reduce systemic risk, the use of cash as initial margin should be subject to diversification requirements at least for systemically important institutions. Systemically important institutions should be required to either limit the amount of initial margin collected in cash or to diversify the exposures by using more than one custodian.
