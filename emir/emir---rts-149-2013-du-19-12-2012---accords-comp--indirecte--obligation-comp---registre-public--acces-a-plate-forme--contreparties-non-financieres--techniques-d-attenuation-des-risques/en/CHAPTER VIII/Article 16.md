1.   Market conditions that prevent marking-to market of an OTC derivative contract shall be considered to occur in either of the following situations:

(a) when the market is inactive;

(b) where the range of reasonable fair values estimates is significant and the probabilities of the various estimates cannot reasonably be assessed.
