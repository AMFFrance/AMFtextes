(18) In some circumstances, it may not be possible to hedge a risk by using a directly related derivative contract, a contract with exactly the same underlying and settlement date as the risk being covered. In such case, the non-financial counterparty may use proxy hedging through a closely correlated instrument to cover its exposure such as an instrument with a different but very close underlying in terms of economic behaviour. Additionally, certain groups of non-financial counterparties which enter into OTC derivative contracts, via a single entity, to hedge their risk in relation to the overall risks of the group may use macro or portfolio hedging. Those macro, portfolio or proxy hedging OTC derivative contracts may constitute hedging for the purpose of this Regulation and should be considered against the criteria for establishing which OTC derivative contracts are objectively reducing risks.
