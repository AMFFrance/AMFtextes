(11) The information to be provided by the competent authority for the purpose of the clearing obligation should enable ESMA to assess the availability of pricing information. In this respect, the access of a CCP to pricing information at one point in time does not mean that market participants could access pricing information in the future. As a result, the fact that a CCP has access to the necessary price information to manage the risks of clearing derivative contracts within a certain class of OTC derivatives does not automatically imply that this class of OTC derivatives should be subject to the clearing obligation.
