(2) Given that pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the provisions of that Regulation would be deemed fulfilled when at least one of the counterparties is established in a country for which the Commission has adopted an implementing act declaring equivalence in accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, these regulatory technical standards should apply to contracts where both counterparties are established in a third country whose legal, supervisory and enforcement arrangements have not yet been declared equivalent to the requirements laid down in that Regulation.
