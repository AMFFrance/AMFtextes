(10) It is desirable to provide technical standards related to contracts that have a direct, substantial and foreseeable effect within the Union as well as technical standards related to the prevention of evasion of rules and obligations provided for in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in a single instrument since both sets of technical standards relate to the clearing obligation and the risk mitigation techniques. Furthermore, they share common features such as their application to a contract whose counterparties would not be subject to the clearing obligation or to the risk mitigation techniques if the conditions of Article 4(1)(a)(v) and Article 11(14)(e) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 specified further by this Regulation were not met.
