(1) The exercise of monetary responsibilities and the management of sovereign debt have a combined impact on the functioning of interest rate markets and should be coordinated to ensure that these two functions are performed efficiently. As Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 excludes from its scope Union central banks and other Union public bodies managing debt so as not to impede their ability to perform tasks of common interest, the application of different rules to such functions when they are exercised by third-country entities would be detrimental to their effectiveness. In order to ensure that third country central banks and other public bodies charged with or intervening in the management of the public debt continue to be in a position to perform their tasks adequately, third-country public bodies charged with or intervening in the management of the public debt should also be exempted from Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.
