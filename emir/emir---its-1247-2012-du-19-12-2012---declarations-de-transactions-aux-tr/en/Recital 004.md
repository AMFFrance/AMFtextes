(4) To ensure consistency, all parties to a derivatives contract should be identified by a unique code. A global legal entity identifier or an interim entity identifier, to be defined under a governance framework which is compatible with the FSB recommendations on data requirements and is adopted for use in the Union, should be used to identify all financial and non-financial counterparties, brokers, central counterparties, and beneficiaries once available, in particular to ensure consistency with the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) report on OTC Derivatives Data Reporting and Aggregation Requirements that describes legal entity identifiers as a tool for data aggregation. In the case of agency trades, the beneficiaries should be identified as the individual or entity on whose behalf the contract was concluded.
