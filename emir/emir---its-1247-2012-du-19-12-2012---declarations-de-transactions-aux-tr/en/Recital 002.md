(2) Since OTC derivatives are typically neither uniquely identifiable by existing codes which are widely used in financial markets, such as the International Securities Identification Numbers (ISIN), nor describable by using the ISO Classification of Financial Instruments (CFI) code, a new and universal method of identification has to be developed. If a unique product identifier is available and follows the principles of uniqueness, neutrality, reliability, open source, scalability, accessibility, has a reasonable cost basis, is offered under an appropriate governance framework and is adopted for use in the Union, it should be used. If a unique product identifier meeting these requirements is not available, an interim taxonomy should be used.
