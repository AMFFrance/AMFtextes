(5) The function of colleges is to facilitate the exercise of the tasks specified in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, and the tasks assigned to college members as well as their composition, establishment and management of colleges have been articulated by the legislator in the Regulation as legal obligations and, therefore, they are binding and directly applicable in all Members States. For the practical functioning of a college a written agreement should be adopted by the members of that college. In order to ensure the use of standard written agreements across CCP colleges, incorporating best practice on college operations, consistent approaches by competent authorities, and to facilitate the swift establishment of CCP colleges within the deadline established by Article 18(1) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, ESMA should issue guidelines and recommendations in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (2).
