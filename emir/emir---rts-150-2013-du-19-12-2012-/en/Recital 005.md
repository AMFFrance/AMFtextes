(5) Although when a trade repository operates through branches, these are not separate legal persons, separate information on branches should be provided in order to enable ESMA to clearly identify the position of the branches in the organisational structure of the trade repository, assess the fitness for duty and appropriateness of the senior management of the branches, and evaluate whether the control mechanisms, compliance and other functions in place are considered to be robust and enough to identify, evaluate and manage the branchesâ€™ risks in an appropriate manner.
