(22) Within a borderless Union settlement market, it is necessary to establish the competences of the different authorities involved in the application of this Regulation. Member States should specifically designate the competent authorities responsible for the application of this Regulation, which should be afforded the supervisory and investigatory powers necessary for the exercise of their functions. A CSD should be subject to authorisation and supervision by the competent authority of its home Member State, which is well placed and should be empowered to examine how CSDs operate on a daily basis, to carry out regular reviews and to take appropriate action when necessary. The competent authority concerned should however consult at the earliest stage and cooperate with other relevant authorities, which include the authorities responsible for the oversight of each securities settlement system operated by the CSD, the central banks that issue the most relevant settlement currencies, where applicable, the relevant central banks that act as settlement agent for each securities settlement system, and, also, where applicable, the competent authorities of other group entities. Such cooperation also implies exchanges of information between the authorities concerned and the immediate notification of those authorities in the case of an emergency situation affecting the liquidity and stability of the financial system in any of the Member States where the CSD or any of its participants is established.
