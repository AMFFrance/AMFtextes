(32) A CSD intending to outsource a core service to a third party or to provide a new core service or an ancillary service not listed in this Regulation, to operate another securities settlement system, to use another settlement agent or to set up any CSD links that involve significant risks should apply for authorisation following the same procedure as that required for initial authorisation, save that the competent authority should inform the applicant CSD within three months whether authorisation has been granted or refused. However, CSD links not involving significant risks or interoperable links of CSDs that outsource their services relating to those interoperable links to public entities, such as the members of the ESCB, should not be subject to prior authorisation, but should be notified by the relevant CSDs to their competent authorities.
