(15) One of the most efficient ways to address settlement fails is to require failing participants to be subject to a compulsory enforcement of the original agreement. This Regulation should provide for uniform rules concerning penalties and certain aspects of the buy-in transaction for all transferable securities, money-market instruments, units in collective investment undertakings and emission allowances, such as timing and pricing. Those rules should be adapted to the specificities of different securities markets, certain trading venues such as SME growth markets as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU and certain complex operations such as very short-term securities repurchase or lending agreements, in order to avoid adversely impacting on the liquidity and efficiency of securities markets. The rules on settlement discipline should be applied in a manner that provides an incentive for the settlement of transactions in all relevant financial instruments by their intended settlement date.
