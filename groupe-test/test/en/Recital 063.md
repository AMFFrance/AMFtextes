(63) In order to provide deterrence and consistent application of the sanctions across Member States, this Regulation should provide a list of key administrative sanctions and other measures that need to be available to the competent authorities, for the power to impose those sanctions and other measures on all persons, whether legal or natural, responsible for an infringement, for a list of key criteria when determining the level and type of those sanctions and other measures and for levels of administrative pecuniary sanctions. Administrative fines should take into account factors such as any identified financial benefit resulting from the infringement, the gravity and duration of the infringement, any aggravating or mitigating factors, the need for administrative fines to have a deterrent effect and, where appropriate, include a discount for cooperation with the competent authority. The adoption and publication of sanctions should respect fundamental rights as laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (‘the Charter’), in particular the rights to respect for private and family life (Article 7), the right to the protection of personal data (Article 8) and the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial (Article 47).
