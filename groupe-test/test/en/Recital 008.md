(8) One of the basic tasks of the ESCB is to promote the smooth operation of payment systems. In this respect, the members of the ESCB execute oversight by ensuring efficient and sound clearing and payment systems. The members of the ESCB often act as settlement agents for the cash leg of securities transactions. They are also significant clients of CSDs, which often manage the collateralisation of monetary policy operations. The members of the ESCB should be closely involved, by being consulted, in the authorisation and supervision of CSDs, the recognition of third-country CSDs and the approval of certain CSD links. To prevent the emergence of parallel sets of rules, they should also be closely involved by being consulted in the setting of regulatory and implementing technical standards as well as of guidelines and recommendations although primary responsibility for the setting of such technical standards, guidelines and recommendations should rest with the Commission and ESMA, as laid down in this Regulation. This Regulation should be without prejudice to the responsibilities of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks to ensure efficient and sound clearing and payment systems within the Union and other countries. This Regulation should not prevent the members of the ESCB from accessing the information relevant for the performance of their duties, including the oversight of CSDs and other financial market infrastructures.
