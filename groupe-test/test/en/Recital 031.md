(31) Without prejudice to specific requirements of Member State tax law, CSDs should be authorised to provide services ancillary to their core services that contribute to enhancing the safety, efficiency and transparency of the securities markets and that do not create undue risks to their core services. A non-exhaustive list of those services is set out in this Regulation in order to enable CSDs to respond to future market developments. Where the provision of such services relates to withholding and reporting obligations to the tax authorities, it will continue to be carried out in accordance with the law of the Member States concerned. In accordance with Article 114(2) TFEU, the power to adopt measures under Article 114(1) does not apply to fiscal provisions. In its judgement of 29 April 2004 in Case C-338/01 Commission v Council  (13), the Court of Justice of the European Union held that the words ‘fiscal provisions’ are to be interpreted as ‘covering not only the provisions determining taxable persons, taxable transactions, the basis of imposition, and rates of and exemptions from direct and indirect taxes, but also those relating to arrangements for the collection of such taxes.’ This Regulation does not therefore cover arrangements for the collection of taxes for which a different legal basis would need to be used.
