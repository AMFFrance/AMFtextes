# Article 37 - Derivatives


1.   When admitting to trading a financial instrument of a kind listed in points of Sections C(4) to (10) of Annex I to Directive 2004/39/EC, regulated markets shall verify that the following conditions are satisfied:

(a) the terms of the contract establishing the financial instrument must be clear and unambiguous, and enable a correlation between the price of the financial instrument and the price or other value measure of the underlying;

(b) the price or other value measure of the underlying must be reliable and publicly available;

(c) sufficient information of a kind needed to value the derivative must be publicly available;

(d) the arrangements for determining the settlement price of the contract must be such that the price properly reflects the price or other value measure of the underlying;

(e) where the settlement of the derivative requires or provides for the possibility of the delivery of an underlying security or asset rather than cash settlement, there must be adequate arrangements to enable market participants to obtain relevant information about that underlying as well as adequate settlement and delivery procedures for the underlying.

2.   Where the financial instruments concerned are of a kind listed in Sections C (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Annex I to Directive 2004/39/EC, point (b) of paragraph 1 shall not apply if the following conditions are satisfied:

(a) the contract establishing that instrument must be likely to provide a means of disclosing to the market, or enabling the market to assess, the price or other value measure of the underlying, where the price or value measure is not otherwise publicly available;

(b) the regulated market must ensure that appropriate supervisory arrangements are in place to monitor trading and settlement in such financial instruments;

(c) the regulated market must ensure that settlement and delivery, whether physical delivery or by cash settlement, can be effected in accordance with the contract terms and conditions of those financial instruments.
