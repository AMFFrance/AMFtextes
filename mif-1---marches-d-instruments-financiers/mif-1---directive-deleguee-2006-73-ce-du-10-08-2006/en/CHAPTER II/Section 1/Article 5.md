(a) to establish, implement and maintain decision-making procedures and an organisational structure which clearly and in documented manner specifies reporting lines and allocates functions and responsibilities;

(b) to ensure that their relevant persons are aware of the procedures which must be followed for the proper discharge of their responsibilities;

(c) to establish, implement and maintain adequate internal control mechanisms designed to secure compliance with decisions and procedures at all levels of the investment firm;

(d) to employ personnel with the skills, knowledge and expertise necessary for the discharge of the responsibilities allocated to them;

(e) to establish, implement and maintain effective internal reporting and communication of information at all relevant levels of the investment firm;

(f) to maintain adequate and orderly records of their business and internal organisation;

(g) to ensure that the performance of multiple functions by their relevant persons does not and is not likely to prevent those persons from discharging any particular function soundly, honestly, and professionally.

4.   Member States shall require investment firms to establish, implement and maintain accounting policies and procedures that enable them, at the request of the competent authority, to deliver in a timely manner to the competent authority financial reports which reflect a true and fair view of their financial position and which comply with all applicable accounting standards and rules.

5.   Member States shall require investment firms to monitor and, on a regular basis, to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of their systems, internal control mechanisms and arrangements established in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 4, and to take appropriate measures to address any deficiencies.
