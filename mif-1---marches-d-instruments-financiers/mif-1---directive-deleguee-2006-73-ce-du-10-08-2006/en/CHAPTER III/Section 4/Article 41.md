# Article 41 - Reporting obligations in respect of portfolio management


1.   Member States shall require investments firms which provide the service of portfolio management to clients to provide each such client with a periodic statement in a durable medium of the portfolio management activities carried out on behalf of that client unless such a statement is provided by another person.

2.   In the case of retail clients, the periodic statement required under paragraph 1 shall include, where relevant, the following information:

(a) the name of the investment firm;

(b) the name or other designation of the retail client's account;

(c) a statement of the contents and the valuation of the portfolio, including details of each financial instrument held, its market value, or fair value if market value is unavailable and the cash balance at the beginning and at the end of the reporting period, and the performance of the portfolio during the reporting period;

(d) the total amount of fees and charges incurred during the reporting period, itemising at least total management fees and total costs associated with execution, and including, where relevant, a statement that a more detailed breakdown will be provided on request;

(e) a comparison of performance during the period covered by the statement with the investment performance benchmark (if any) agreed between the investment firm and the client;

(f) the total amount of dividends, interest and other payments received during the reporting period in relation to the client's portfolio;

(g) information about other corporate actions giving rights in relation to financial instruments held in the portfolio;

(h) for each transaction executed during the period, the information referred to in Article 40(4)(c) to (l) where relevant, unless the client elects to receive information about executed transactions on a transaction-by-transaction basis, in which case paragraph 4 of this Article shall apply.

3.   In the case of retail clients, the periodic statement referred to in paragraph 1 shall be provided once every six months, except in the following cases:

(a) where the client so requests, the periodic statement must be provided every three months;

(b) in cases where paragraph 4 applies, the periodic statement must be provided at least once every 12 months;

(c) where the agreement between an investment firm and a retail client for a portfolio management service authorises a leveraged portfolio, the periodic statement must be provided at least once a month.

Investment firms shall inform retail clients that they have the right to make requests for the purposes of point (a).

However, the exception provided for in point (b) shall not apply in the case of transactions in financial instruments covered by Article 4(1)(18)(c) of, or any of points 4 to 10 of Section C in Annex I to, Directive 2004/39/EC.

4.   Member States shall require investment firms, in cases where the client elects to receive information about executed transactions on a transaction-by-transaction basis, to provide promptly to the client, on the execution of a transaction by the portfolio manager, the essential information concerning that transaction in a durable medium.

Where the client concerned is a retail client, the investment firm must send him a notice confirming the transaction and containing the information referred to in Article 40(4) no later than the first business day following that execution or, if the confirmation is received by the investment firm from a third party, no later than the first business day following receipt of the confirmation from the third party.

The second subparagraph shall not apply where the confirmation would contain the same information as a confirmation that is to be promptly dispatched to the retail client by another person.
