(5) A high-level expert group chaired by Erkki Liikanen adopted a report on reforming the structure of the Union banking sector in October 2012. It considered, among other things, the interaction between the traditional and the shadow banking systems. The report recognised the risks of shadow banking activities such as high leverage and pro-cyclicality, and it called for a reduction of the interconnectedness between banks and the shadow banking system, which had been a source of contagion in a system-wide banking crisis. The report also suggested certain structural measures to deal with remaining weaknesses in the Union banking sector.
