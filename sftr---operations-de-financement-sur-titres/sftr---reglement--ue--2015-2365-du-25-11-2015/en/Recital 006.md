(6) Structural reforms of the Union banking system are dealt with in a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on structural measures improving the resilience of EU credit institutions. However, imposing structural measures on banks could result in certain activities being shifted to less-regulated areas such as the shadow banking sector. That proposal should therefore be accompanied by the binding transparency and reporting requirements for SFTs laid down in this Regulation. Thus, the transparency rules laid down in this Regulation complement that proposal.
