(26) In order to ensure compliance by counterparties with the obligations deriving from this Regulation and that they are subject to similar treatment across the Union, Member States should ensure that competent authorities have the power to impose administrative sanctions and other administrative measures which are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Therefore, administrative sanctions and other administrative measures laid down in this Regulation should satisfy certain essential requirements in relation to addressees, criteria to be taken into account when applying a sanction or measure, publication of sanctions or measures, key powers to impose sanctions and levels of administrative pecuniary sanctions. It is appropriate that sanctions and other measures established under Directives 2009/65/EC and 2011/61/EU apply to infringements of the transparency obligations relating to the collective investment undertakings under this Regulation.
