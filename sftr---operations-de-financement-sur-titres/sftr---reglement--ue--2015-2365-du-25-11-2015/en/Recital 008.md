(8) The evolution of market practices and technological developments enable market participants to use transactions other than SFTs as a source of funding, for liquidity and collateral management, as a yield-enhancement strategy, to cover short sales or for dividend tax arbitrage. Such transactions could have an equivalent economic effect and pose risks similar to SFTs, including pro-cyclicality brought about by fluctuating asset values and volatility; maturity or liquidity transformation stemming from financing long-term or illiquid assets through short-term or liquid assets; and financial contagion arising from interconnectedness of chains of transactions involving collateral reuse.
