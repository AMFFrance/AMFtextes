(14) It is necessary to introduce provisions on the exchange of information between competent authorities and to strengthen the duties of assistance and cooperation which they owe each other. Due to increasing cross-border activity, competent authorities should provide each other with the relevant information for the exercise of their functions in order to ensure the effective enforcement of this Regulation, including in situations where infringements or suspected infringements may be of concern to authorities in two or more Member States. In the exchange of information, strict professional secrecy is needed to ensure the smooth transmission of that information and the protection of particular rights. Without prejudice to national criminal or tax law, the competent authorities, ESMA, bodies or natural or legal persons other than the competent authorities, which receive confidential information, should use it only in the performance of their duties and for the exercise of their functions. However, this should not prevent the exercise, in accordance with national law, of the functions of national bodies responsible for the prevention, investigation or correction of cases of maladministration.
