(12) Transactions with members of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) should be exempted from the obligation to report SFTs to trade repositories. However, in order to ensure that regulators and supervisors obtain a proper overview of the risks linked to SFTs concluded by the entities they regulate or supervise, the relevant authorities and the members of the ESCB should cooperate closely. Such cooperation should enable regulators and supervisors to fulfil their respective responsibilities and mandates. Such cooperation should be confidential, and conditional on a justified request from the relevant competent authorities, and should only be provided with a view to enabling those authorities to fulfil their respective responsibilities having due regard to the principles and requirements of the independence of central banks and the performance by them of their functions as monetary authorities, including the performance of monetary, foreign exchange and financial stability policy operations which members of the ESCB are legally empowered to pursue. The members of the ESCB should be able to refuse to provide information where the transactions are entered into by them in the performance of their functions as monetary authorities. They should notify the requesting authority of any such refusal together with the justification therefor.
