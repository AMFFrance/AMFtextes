(2) In the context of its work to curb shadow banking, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) established by Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) have identified the risks posed by securities financing transactions (SFTs). SFTs allow the build-up of leverage, pro-cyclicality and interconnectedness in the financial markets. In particular, a lack of transparency in the use of SFTs has prevented regulators and supervisors as well as investors from correctly assessing and monitoring the respective bank-like risks and level of interconnectedness in the financial system in the period preceding and during the financial crisis. Against this background, on 29 August 2013, the FSB adopted the policy framework entitled ‘Strengthening Oversight and Regulation of Shadow Banking’ (‘FSB Policy Framework’) for addressing shadow banking risks in securities lending and repos, which was endorsed in September 2013 by the G20 Leaders.
