(42) The new uniform rules on the transparency of SFTs and certain over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, namely total return swaps, laid down in this Regulation are closely linked to the rules laid down in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, as those OTC derivatives fall within the scope of the reporting requirements laid down in that Regulation. In order to ensure a coherent scope of both sets of transparency and reporting requirements, a clear delineation between OTC derivatives and exchange-traded derivatives is needed irrespective of whether those contracts are traded in the Union or in third-country markets. The definition of OTC derivatives in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 should therefore be amended in order to ensure that the same type of derivatives contracts are identified as either OTC derivatives or exchange-traded derivatives irrespective of whether those contracts are traded in the Union or in third-country markets.
