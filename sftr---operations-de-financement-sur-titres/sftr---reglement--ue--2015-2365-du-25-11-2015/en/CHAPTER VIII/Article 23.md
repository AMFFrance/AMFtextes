(a) the gravity and duration of the infringement;

(b) the degree of responsibility of the person responsible for the infringement;

(c) the financial strength of the person responsible for the infringement, by considering factors such as the total turnover in the case of a legal person or the annual income in the case of a natural person;

(d) the importance of the profits gained or losses avoided by the person responsible for the infringement, insofar as they can be determined;

(e) the level of cooperation of the person responsible for the infringement with the competent authority, without prejudice to the need to ensure disgorgement of profits gained or losses avoided by that person;

(f) previous infringements by the person responsible for the infringement.
