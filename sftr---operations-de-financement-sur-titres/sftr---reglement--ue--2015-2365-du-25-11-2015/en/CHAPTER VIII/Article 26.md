# Article 26 - Publication of decisions


1.   Subject to paragraph 4 of this Article, Member States shall ensure that competent authorities publish any decision imposing an administrative sanction or other administrative measure in relation to infringements of Article 4 or 15 on their website immediately after the person subject to that decision has been informed of that decision.

2.   The information published pursuant to paragraph 1 shall specify at least the type and nature of the infringement and the identity of the person subject to the decision.

3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to decisions imposing measures that are of an investigatory nature.

Where a competent authority considers, following a case-by-case assessment, that the publication of the identity of the legal person subject to the decision, or the personal data of a natural person, would be disproportionate, or where such publication would jeopardise an ongoing investigation or the stability of the financial markets, it shall do one of the following:

(a) defer publication of the decision until the reasons for that deferral cease to exist;

(b) publish the decision on an anonymous basis in accordance with national law where such publication ensures effective protection of the personal data concerned and, where appropriate, postpone publication of the relevant data for a reasonable period of time where it is foreseeable that the reasons for anonymous publication will cease to exist during that period;

(c) not publish the decision in the event that the competent authority is of the opinion that publication in accordance with point (a) or (b) will be insufficient to ensure: (i) that the stability of financial markets is not jeopardised; or (ii) the proportionality of the publication of such decisions with regard to measures which are deemed to be of a minor nature.

4.   Where the decision is subject to an appeal before a national judicial, administrative or other authority, competent authorities shall also publish immediately on their website such information and any subsequent information on the outcome of such an appeal. Any decision annulling a decision subject to appeal shall also be published.

5.   Competent authorities shall inform ESMA of all administrative sanctions and other administrative measures imposed but not published, in accordance with point (c) of paragraph 3, including any appeal in relation thereto and the outcome thereof. Member States shall ensure that competent authorities receive information and the final judgement in relation to any criminal sanction imposed and submit it to ESMA. ESMA shall maintain a central database of administrative sanctions, other administrative measures and criminal sanctions communicated to it solely for the purposes of exchanging information between competent authorities. That database shall be accessible only to competent authorities and it shall be updated on the basis of the information provided by the competent authorities.

6.   Competent authorities shall ensure that any decision that is published in accordance with this Article remain accessible on their website for a period of at least five years after its publication. Personal data contained in those decisions shall be retained on the website of the competent authority for the period which is necessary, in accordance with the applicable data protection rules.
