5.   A trade repository shall submit to ESMA either of the following:

(a) an application for registration;

(b) an application for an extension of registration for the purposes of Article 4 of this Regulation in the case of a trade repository already registered under Title VI, Chapter 1 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.

6.   ESMA shall assess whether the application is complete within 20 working days of receipt of the application.

Where the application is not complete, ESMA shall set a deadline by which the trade repository is to provide additional information.

After assessing an application as complete, ESMA shall notify the trade repository accordingly.
