(20) The provision of borrowing rates by creditors should not be considered to be benchmark provision for the purposes of this Regulation. A borrowing rate provided by a creditor is either set by an internal decision or calculated as a spread or mark-up over an index (e.g. EURIBOR). In the first case, the creditor is exempt from this Regulation for activity concerning financial contracts entered into by that creditor with its own clients, while in the latter case the creditor is considered to be only a user of a benchmark.
