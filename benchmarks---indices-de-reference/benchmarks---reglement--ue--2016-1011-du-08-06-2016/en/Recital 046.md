(46) This Regulation also introduces an endorsement regime allowing, under certain conditions, administrators or supervised entities located in the Union to endorse benchmarks provided from a third country in order for such benchmarks to be used in the Union. To do so, the competent authority should take into account whether, in providing the benchmark to be endorsed, compliance with the IOSCO principles would be equivalent to compliance with this Regulation, taking into account the specificities of the regime of endorsement as compared to the equivalence regime. An administrator or a supervised entity that has endorsed a benchmark provided from a third country should be fully responsible for such endorsed benchmarks and for the fulfilment of the relevant conditions referred to in this Regulation.
