(52) Existing recordings of telephone conversations and data traffic records from supervised entities can constitute crucial, and sometimes the only, evidence to detect and prove the existence of infringements of this Regulation, in particular the compliance with governance and control requirements. Such records and recordings can help to verify the identity of the person responsible for the submission of input data, those responsible for its approval and whether organisational separation of employees is maintained. Therefore, competent authorities should be able to require existing recordings of telephone conversations, electronic communications and data traffic records held by supervised entities, in those cases where a reasonable suspicion exists that such recordings or records related to the subject-matter of the inspection or investigation could be relevant to prove an infringement of this Regulation.
