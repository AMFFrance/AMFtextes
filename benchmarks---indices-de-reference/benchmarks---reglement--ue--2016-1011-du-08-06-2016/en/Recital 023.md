(23) Auditing and the effective enforcement of this Regulation requires ex post analysis and evidence. This Regulation should therefore set out requirements for adequate record-keeping by benchmark administrators relating to the calculation of the benchmark for a sufficient period of time. The reality that a benchmark intends to measure and the environment in which it is measured are likely to change over time. Therefore it is necessary that the process and methodology of the provision of benchmarks are reviewed on a periodic basis to identify shortcomings and possible improvements. Many stakeholders can be impacted by failures in the provision of the benchmark and can help identify such shortcomings. This Regulation should therefore set out a framework for the establishment of a complaints handling mechanism by benchmark administrators to enable stakeholders to notify the benchmark administrator of complaints and ensure that the benchmark administrator objectively evaluates the merits of any complaint.
