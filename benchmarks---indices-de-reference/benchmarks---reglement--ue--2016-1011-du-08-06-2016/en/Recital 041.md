(41) Administrators of significant benchmarks should be able to choose not to apply a limited number of detailed requirements of this Regulation. Competent authorities should, however, maintain the right to require the application of those requirements, based on criteria outlined in this Regulation. Delegated acts and implementing acts that apply to significant benchmark administrators should take due account of the principle of proportionality and aim to avoid administrative burden where possible.
