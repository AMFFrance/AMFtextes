(44) This Regulation should take into account the IOSCO principles, which serve as global standards for regulatory requirements for benchmarks. As an overarching principle, in order to ensure investor protection, supervision and regulation in a third country should be equivalent to Union supervision and regulation of benchmarks. Therefore, benchmarks provided from that third country can be used by supervised entities in the Union where a positive decision on equivalence of the third- country regime has been taken by the Commission. In such circumstances, competent authorities should enter into cooperation arrangements with supervisory authorities in third countries. ESMA should coordinate the development of such cooperation arrangements and the exchange between competent authorities of information received from third countries. However, in order to avoid any adverse impact resulting from a possible abrupt cessation of the use in the Union of benchmarks provided from a third country, this Regulation also provides for certain other mechanisms (namely, recognition and endorsement) under which third-country benchmarks can be used by supervised entities located in the Union.
