(61) In order to ensure that decisions made by competent authorities to impose an administrative sanction or other administrative measure have a deterrent effect on the public at large, they should be published. The publication of decisions imposing an administrative sanction or other administrative measure is also an important tool for competent authorities to inform market participants of the type of behaviour that is considered to infringe this Regulation and to promote wider good behaviour amongst market participants. If such publication risks causing disproportionate damage to the persons involved, or jeopardises the stability of financial markets or an on-going investigation, the competent authority should either publish the administrative sanction or other administrative measure on an anonymous basis or delay the publication. In addition, competent authorities should have the option not to publish a decision imposing administrative sanctions or other administrative measures at all where anonymous or delayed publication is considered insufficient to ensure that the stability of financial markets is not jeopardised. Competent authorities are also not required to publish administrative sanctions or other administrative measures which are deemed to be of a minor nature where publication would be disproportionate.
