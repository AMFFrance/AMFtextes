(32) Many benchmarks are determined by the application of a formula using input data that is provided by the following entities: a trading venue, an approved publication arrangement, a consolidated tape provider, an approved reporting mechanism, an energy exchange or an emission allowance auction platform. In some situations, data collection is outsourced to a service provider that receives the data entirely and directly from those entities. In those cases, existing regulation and supervision ensure the integrity and transparency of the input data and provide for governance requirements and procedures for the notification of infringements. Therefore, those benchmarks are less vulnerable to manipulation, are subject to independent verifications, and the relevant administrators are accordingly released from certain obligations set out in this Regulation.
