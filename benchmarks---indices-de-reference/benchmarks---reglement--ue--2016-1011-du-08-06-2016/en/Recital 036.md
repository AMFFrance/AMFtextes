(36) Critical benchmarks can be determined using a quantitative criterion or a combination of quantitative and qualitative criteria. In addition, in cases where a benchmark does not meet the appropriate quantitative threshold, it could nonetheless be recognised as critical where the benchmark has no or very few market-led substitutes and its existence and accuracy are relevant for market integrity, financial stability or consumer protection in one or more Member States, and where all the relevant competent authorities agree that such a benchmark should be recognised as critical. In the event of disagreement between the relevant competent authorities, the decision of the competent authority of the administrator on whether such a benchmark should be recognised as critical should prevail. In such a case, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10), should be able to publish an opinion on the assessment made by the competent authority of the administrator. Furthermore, a competent authority can also designate a benchmark as critical based on certain qualitative criteria where the administrator and the majority of the contributors to the benchmark are located in its Member State. All critical benchmarks should be included in a list established by a way of an implementing act by the Commission, which should be reviewed and updated regularly.
