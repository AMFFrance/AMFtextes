(35) The failure of critical benchmarks can impact market integrity, financial stability, consumers, the real economy, or the financing of households and businesses in Member States. Those potentially destabilising effects of the failure of a critical benchmark could be felt in a single Member State or in more than one. It is therefore necessary that this Regulation provides for a process to determine those benchmarks that should be considered to be critical benchmarks and that additional requirements apply to ensure the integrity and robustness of such benchmarks.
