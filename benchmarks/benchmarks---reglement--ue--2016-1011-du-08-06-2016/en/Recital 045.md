(45) This Regulation introduces a process for the recognition of administrators located in a third country by the competent authority of the Member State of reference. Recognition should be granted to administrators complying with the requirements of this Regulation. Acknowledging the role of the IOSCO principles as a global standard for the provision of benchmarks, the competent authority of the Member State of reference should be able to grant recognition to administrators on the basis of them applying the IOSCO principles. To do so, the competent authority should assess the application of the IOSCO principles by a specific administrator and determine whether such application is equivalent, for the administrator in question, to compliance with the various requirements established in this Regulation, taking into account the specificities of the regime of recognition as compared to the equivalence regime.
