(48) Certain administrators should be authorised and supervised by the competent authority of the Member State where the administrator in question is located. Entities already subject to supervision and that provide financial benchmarks other than critical benchmarks should be registered and supervised by the competent authority for the purposes of this Regulation. Entities that provide only indices that qualify as non-significant benchmarks should also be registered by the relevant competent authority. Authorisation and registration should be distinct processes with authorisation requiring a more extensive assessment of the administrator's application. Whether an administrator is authorised or registered should not affect the supervision of that administrator by the relevant competent authorities. Additionally, a transitional regime should be introduced, according to which persons providing benchmarks which are not critical and are not widely used in one or more Member States could be registered, with a view to facilitating the initial phase of application of this Regulation. ESMA should maintain at the Union level a register that contains information on authorised or registered administrators, on benchmarks and the administrators that provide those benchmarks by virtue of a positive decision under either the equivalence regime or the recognition regime, on Union administrators or supervised entities that have endorsed benchmarks from a third country, and on any such endorsed benchmarks and their administrators located in a third country.
