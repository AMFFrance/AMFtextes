(57) Administrative sanctions and other administrative measures applied in specific cases should be determined taking into account, where appropriate, factors such as the repayment of any identified financial benefit, the gravity and duration of the infringement, any aggravating or mitigating factors, the need for administrative pecuniary sanctions to have a deterrent effect and, where appropriate, include a reduction in return for cooperation with the competent authority. In particular, the actual amount of administrative pecuniary sanctions to be imposed in a specific case should be able to reach the maximum level provided for in this Regulation, or the higher level provided for in national law, for very serious infringements, while administrative pecuniary sanctions significantly lower than the maximum level should be able to be applied to minor infringements or in case of settlement. The possibility of imposing a temporary ban on the exercise of management functions within benchmark administrators or contributors should be available to the competent authority.
