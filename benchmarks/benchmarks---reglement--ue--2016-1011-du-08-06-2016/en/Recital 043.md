(43) In order for users of benchmarks to choose appropriately from among, and understand the risks of, benchmarks, they need to know what a given benchmark intends to measure and its susceptibility to manipulation. Therefore, the benchmark administrator should publish a benchmark statement specifying those elements. In order to ensure uniform application and that benchmark statements are of reasonable length but at the same time focus on providing the key information needed to users in an easily accessible manner, ESMA should provide further specification of the content of the benchmark statement, differentiating appropriately among the different types and specificities of benchmarks and their administrators.
