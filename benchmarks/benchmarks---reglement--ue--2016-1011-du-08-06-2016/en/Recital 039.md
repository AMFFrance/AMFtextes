(39) Contributors that cease to contribute input data to critical benchmarks can undermine the credibility of such benchmarks, as the capability of such benchmarks to measure the underlying market or economic reality would as a result be impaired. It is therefore necessary to include a power for the relevant competent authority to require mandatory contributions from supervised entities to critical benchmarks in order to preserve the credibility of the benchmark in question. Mandatory contribution of input data is not intended to impose an obligation on supervised entities to enter into, or to commit to entering into, transactions.
