(34) Physical commodities markets have unique characteristics which should be taken into account. Commodity benchmarks are widely used and can have sector-specific characteristics, so it is necessary to introduce specific provisions in this Regulation for such benchmarks. Certain commodity benchmarks are exempt from this Regulation but would need to nevertheless respect the relevant IOSCO principles. Commodity benchmarks can become critical since the regime is not limited to benchmarks based on submissions by contributors which are in majority supervised entities. For critical commodity benchmarks subject to Annex II, the requirements of this Regulation regarding mandatory contribution and colleges are not applicable.
