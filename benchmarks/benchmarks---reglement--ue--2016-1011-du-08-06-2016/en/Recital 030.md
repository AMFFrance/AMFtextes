(30) The integrity and accuracy of benchmarks depends on the integrity and accuracy of the input data provided by contributors. It is essential that the obligations of contributors in respect of such input data are clearly specified, that compliance with those obligations can be relied upon, and that the obligations are consistent with the benchmark administrator's controls and methodology. It is therefore necessary that the benchmark administrator produces a code of conduct to specify those requirements and the contributor's responsibilities concerning the provision of input data. The administrator should be satisfied that contributors adhere to the code of conduct. Where contributors are located in third countries, the administrator should be satisfied to the extent possible.
