(60) It is necessary to reinforce provisions on exchange of information between competent authorities and to strengthen the duties of assistance and cooperation which they owe to each other. Due to increasing cross-border activity, competent authorities should provide each other with the relevant information for the exercise of their function, so as to ensure the effective enforcement of this Regulation, including in situations where an infringement or suspected infringement is of concern to authorities in two or more Member States. When exchanging information, strict professional secrecy is needed to ensure the smooth transmission of that information and the protection of particular rights.
