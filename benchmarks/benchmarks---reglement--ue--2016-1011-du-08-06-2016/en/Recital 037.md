(37) The cessation of the administration of a critical benchmark by an administrator could render financial contracts or financial instruments invalid, cause losses to consumers and investors, and impact financial stability. It is therefore necessary to include a power for the relevant competent authority to require mandatory administration of a critical benchmark in order to preserve the existence of the benchmark in question. In the event of insolvency proceedings of a benchmark administrator, the competent authority should provide an assessment for the consideration of the relevant judicial authority of whether and how the critical benchmark could be transitioned to a new administrator or could cease to be provided.
