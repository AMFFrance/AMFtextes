(42) Administrators of non-significant benchmarks are subject to a less detailed regime, whereby administrators should be able to choose not to apply some requirements of this Regulation. In such a case, the administrator in question should explain why it is appropriate not to do so in a compliance statement which should be published and provided to the administrator's competent authority. That competent authority should review the compliance statement and should be able to request additional information or require changes to ensure compliance with this Regulation. While non-significant benchmarks could still be vulnerable to manipulation, they are more easily substitutable, therefore transparency to users should be the main tool used for market participants to make informed choices about the benchmarks they consider appropriate for use. For that reason, the delegated acts in Title II should not apply to non-significant benchmark administrators.
