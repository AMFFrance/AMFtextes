(7) Based on calculations by the European Central Bank derived from the daily reports of the 52 largest European banks under the money market statistical reporting, the outstanding amounts of the captured money market instruments in the unsecured and the secured market which reference EONIA can be estimated at around EUR 450 billion and EUR 400 billion for this sample of banks alone. In addition, it is estimated that the vast majority of trades in the euro overnight index swap (OIS) market, with notional amount of some EUR 5,2 trillion, are linked to EONIA. EONIA is therefore used directly or indirectly within a combination of benchmarks as a reference for financial instruments or financial contracts or for measuring the performance of investment funds, having a total value of at least EUR 500 billion on the basis of all the ranges of maturities.
