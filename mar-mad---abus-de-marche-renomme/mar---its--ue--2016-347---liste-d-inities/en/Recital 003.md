(3) Since multiple pieces of inside information can exist within an entity at the same time, insider lists should precisely identify the specific pieces of inside information to which persons working for issuers, emission allowance market participants, auction platforms, auctioneers and auction monitor have had access to (whether it is, inter alia, a deal, a project, a corporate or a financial event, publication of financial statements or profit warnings). To that end, the insider list should be divided into sections with a separate section for each piece of inside information. Each section should list all persons having access to the same specific piece of inside information.
