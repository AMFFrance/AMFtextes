# Article 7 - Record-keeping of reports received


1.   Member States shall ensure that competent authorities keep records of every report of infringement received.

2.   Competent authorities shall promptly acknowledge the receipt of written reports of infringements to the postal or electronic address indicated by the reporting person, unless the reporting person explicitly requested otherwise or the competent authority reasonably believes that acknowledging receipt of a written report would jeopardise the protection of the reporting person's identity.

3.   Where a recorded telephone line is used for reporting of infringements, the competent authority shall have the right to document the oral reporting in the form of:

(a) an audio recording of the conversation in a durable and retrievable form; or

(b) a complete and accurate transcript of the conversation prepared by the dedicated staff members of the competent authority. In cases where the reporting person has disclosed its identity, the competent authority shall offer the possibility to the reporting person to check, rectify and agree with the transcript of the call by signing it.

4.   Where an unrecorded telephone line is used for reporting of infringements, the competent authority shall have the right to document the oral reporting in the form of accurate minutes of the conversation prepared by the dedicated staff members of the competent authority. In cases where the reporting person has disclosed its identity, the competent authority shall offer the possibility to the reporting person to check, rectify and agree with the minutes of the call by signing them.

5.   Where a person requests a physical meeting with the dedicated staff members of the competent authority for reporting an infringement according to Article 6(3)(c), competent authorities shall ensure that complete and accurate records of the meeting are kept in a durable and retrievable form. A competent authority shall have the right to document the records of the physical meeting in the form of:

(a) an audio recording of the conversation in a durable and retrievable form; or

(b) accurate minutes of the meeting prepared by the dedicated staff members of the competent authority. In cases where the reporting person has disclosed its identity, the competent authority shall offer the possibility to the reporting person to check, rectify and agree with the minutes of the meeting by signing them.
