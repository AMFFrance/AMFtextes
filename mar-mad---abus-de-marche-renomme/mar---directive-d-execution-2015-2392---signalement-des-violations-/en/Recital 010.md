(10) Protection of personal data of the reporting and reported person is crucial in order to avoid unfair treatment or reputational damages due to disclosure of personal data, in particular data revealing the identity of a person concerned. Hence, in addition to the national data protection legislation which transposes Directive 95/46/EC, competent authorities should establish adequate data protection procedures specifically geared to the protection of the reporting and reported person that should include a secure system within the competent authority with restricted access rights for authorised staff only.
