Such delegation should make it possible to share resources, to centrally develop and maintain monitoring systems and to build expertise in the context of monitoring orders and transactions. Such delegationg should not prevent the competent authorities from assessing, at any time, whether the systems, arrangements and procedures of the person to whom the functions are delegated are effective to comply with the obligation to monitor and detect market abuse. The obligation to report as well as the responsibility to comply with this Regulation and with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 should remain with the delegating person.
