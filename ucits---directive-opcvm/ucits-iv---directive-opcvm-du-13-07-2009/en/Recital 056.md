(56) The conversion rules should enable an existing UCITS to convert into a feeder UCITS. At the same time they should sufficiently protect unit-holders. As conversion is a fundamental change of the investment policy, the converting UCITS should be required to provide its unit-holders with sufficient information in order to enable them to decide whether to maintain their investment. The competent authorities should not require the feeder UCITS to provide more or information other than that specified in this Directive.
