# Article 81 - null


1.   Member States shall allow investment companies and, for each of the common funds they manage, management companies, to provide key investor information in a durable medium or by means of a website. A paper copy shall be delivered to the investor on request and free of charge.

In addition, an up-to-date version of the key investor information shall be made available on the website of the investment company or management company.

2.   The Commission may adopt implementing measures which define the specific conditions which need to be met when providing key investor information in a durable medium other than on paper or by means of a website which does not constitute a durable medium.

Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 112(2).
