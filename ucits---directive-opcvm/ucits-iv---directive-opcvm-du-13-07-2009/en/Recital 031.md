(31) Third-party control of mergers should also be ensured. The depositaries of each of the UCITS involved in the merger should verify the conformity of the common draft terms of the merger with the relevant provisions of this Directive and of the UCITS fund rules. Either a depositary or an independent auditor should draw-up a report on behalf of all the UCITS involved in the merger validating the valuation methods of the assets and liabilities of such UCITS and the calculation method of the exchange ratio as set out in the common draft terms of merger as well as the actual exchange ratio and, where applicable, the cash payment per unit. In order to limit costs connected with cross-border mergers, it should be possible to draw up a single report for all UCITS involved and the statutory auditor of the merging or the receiving UCITS should be enabled to do so. For investor protection reasons, unit-holders should be able to obtain a copy of such report on request and free of charge.
