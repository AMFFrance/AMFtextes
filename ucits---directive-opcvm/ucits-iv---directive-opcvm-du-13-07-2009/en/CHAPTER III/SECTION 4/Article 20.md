1.   Without prejudice to Article 5, a management company which applies to manage a UCITS established in another Member State shall provide the competent authorities of the UCITS home Member State with the following documentation:

(a) the written agreement with the depositary referred to in Articles 23 and 33; and

(b) information on delegation arrangements regarding functions of investment management and administration referred to in Annex II.

If a management company already manages other UCITS of the same type in the UCITS home Member State, reference to the documentation already provided shall be sufficient.

2.   In so far as it is necessary to ensure compliance with the rules for which they are responsible, the competent authorities of the UCITS home Member State may ask the competent authorities of the management company’s home Member State for clarification and information regarding the documentation referred to in paragraph 1 and, based on the attestation referred to in Articles 17 and 18, as to whether the type of UCITS for which authorisation is requested falls within the scope of the management company’s authorisation. Where applicable, the competent authorities of the management company’s home Member State shall provide their opinion within 10 working days of the initial request.

3.   The competent authorities of the UCITS home Member State may refuse the application of the management company only if:

(a) the management company does not comply with the rules falling under their responsibility pursuant to Article 19;

(b) the management company is not authorised by the competent authorities of its home Member State to manage the type of UCITS for which authorisation is requested; or

(c) the management company has not provided the documentation referred to in paragraph 1.

Before refusing an application, the competent authorities of the UCITS home Member State shall consult the competent authorities of the management company’s home Member State.

4.   Any subsequent material modifications of the documentation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be notified by the management company to the competent authorities of the UCITS home Member State.
