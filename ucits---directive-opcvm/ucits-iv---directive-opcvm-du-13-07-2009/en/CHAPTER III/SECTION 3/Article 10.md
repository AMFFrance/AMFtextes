# Article 10 - null


1.   The competent authorities of the management company’s home Member State shall require that the management company which they have authorised complies at all times with the conditions laid down in Article 6 and Article 7(1) and (2).

The own funds of a management company shall not fall below the level specified in Article 7(1)(a). If they do, however, the competent authorities may, where the circumstances so justify, allow such firms a limited period in which to rectify their situations or cease their activities.

2.   The prudential supervision of a management company shall be the responsibility of the competent authorities of the management company’s home Member State, whether the management company establishes a branch or provides services in another Member State or not, without prejudice to those provisions of this Directive which confer responsibility to the competent authorities of a management company’s host Member State.
