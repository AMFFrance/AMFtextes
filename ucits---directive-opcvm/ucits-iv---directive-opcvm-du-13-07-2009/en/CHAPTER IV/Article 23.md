# Article 23 - null


1.   A depositary shall either have its registered office or be established in the UCITS home Member State.

2.   A depositary shall be an institution which is subject to prudential regulation and ongoing supervision. It shall also furnish sufficient financial and professional guarantees to be able effectively to pursue its business as depositary and meet the commitments inherent in that function.

3.   Member States shall determine which of the categories of institutions referred to in paragraph 2 shall be eligible to be depositaries.

4.   The depositary shall enable the competent authorities of the UCITS home Member State to obtain, on request, all information that the depositary has obtained while discharging its duties and that is necessary for the competent authorities to supervise the UCITS compliance with this Directive.

5.   Where the management company’s home Member State is not the UCITS home Member State, the depositary shall sign a written agreement with the management company regulating the flow of information deemed necessary to allow it to perform the functions set out in Article 22 and in other laws, regulations or administrative provisions which are relevant for depositaries in the UCITS home Member State.

6.   The Commission may adopt implementing measures in relation to the measures to be taken by a depositary in order to fulfil its duties regarding a UCITS managed by a management company established in another Member State, including the particulars that need to be included in the standard agreement to be used by the depositary and the management company in accordance with paragraph 5.

Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 112(2).
