(19) Where the UCITS is managed by a management company authorised in a Member State other than the UCITS home Member State, that management company should adopt and establish appropriate procedures and arrangements to deal with investor complaints, such as through appropriate provisions in distribution arrangements or through an address in the UCITS home Member State, which should not need to be an address of the management company itself. Such a management company should also establish appropriate procedures and arrangements to make information available at the request of the public or the competent authorities of the UCITS home Member State, such as through the designation of a contact person, from among the employees of the management company, to deal with requests for information. However, such a management company should not be required by the law of the UCITS home Member State to have a local representative in that Member State in order to fulfil those duties.
