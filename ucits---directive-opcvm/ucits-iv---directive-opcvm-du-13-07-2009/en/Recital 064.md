(64) In order to facilitate cross-border marketing of units of UCITS, control of compliance of arrangements made for marketing of units of UCITS with laws, regulations and administrative procedures applicable in the UCITS host Member State, should be performed after the UCITS has accessed the market of that Member State. That control could cover the adequacy of arrangements made for marketing, in particular the adequacy of distribution arrangements and the obligation for marketing communications to be presented in a manner that is fair, clear and not misleading. This Directive should not prevent the competent authorities of the host Member State from verifying that marketing communications, not including key investor information, the prospectus and annual and half-yearly reports, comply with national law before the UCITS can use them, subject to such control being non-discriminatory and not preventing that UCITS from accessing the market.
