(40) In order to take into account market developments and in consideration of the completion of economic and monetary union it is desirable to permit UCITS to invest in bank deposits. To ensure adequate liquidity of investments in deposits, those deposits should be repayable on demand or have the right to be withdrawn. If the deposits are made with a credit institution the registered office of which is located in a third country, the credit institution should be subject to prudential rules equivalent to those laid down in Community law.
