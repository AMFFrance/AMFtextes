(59) Key investor information should be provided as a specific document to investors, free of charge, in good time before the subscription of the UCITS, in order to help them to reach informed investment decisions. Such key investor information should contain only the essential elements for making such decisions. The nature of the information to be found in the key investor information should be fully harmonised so as to ensure adequate investor protection and comparability. Key investor information should be presented in a short format. A single document of limited length presenting the information in a specified sequence is the most appropriate manner in which to achieve the clarity and simplicity of presentation that is required by retail investors, and should allow for useful comparisons, notably of costs and risk profile, relevant to the investment decision.
