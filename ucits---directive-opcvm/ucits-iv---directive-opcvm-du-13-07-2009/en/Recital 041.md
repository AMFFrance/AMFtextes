(41) In addition to the case in which a UCITS invests in bank deposits in accordance with its fund rules or instruments of incorporation, it should be possible to allow all UCITS to hold ancillary liquid assets, such as bank deposits at sight. The holding of such ancillary liquid assets may be justified, inter alia, in order to cover current or exceptional payments; in the case of sales, for the time necessary to reinvest in transferable securities, money market instruments or in other financial assets provided for in this Directive; or for a period of time strictly necessary when, because of unfavourable market conditions, the investment in transferable securities, money market instruments and in other financial assets is suspended.
