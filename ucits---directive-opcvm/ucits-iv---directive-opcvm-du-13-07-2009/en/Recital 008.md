(8) An authorisation granted to the management company in its home Member State should ensure investor protection and the solvency of management companies, with a view to contributing to the stability of the financial system. The approach adopted in this Directive is to ensure the essential harmonisation necessary and sufficient to secure the mutual recognition of authorisation and of prudential supervision systems, making possible the grant of a single authorisation valid throughout the Community and the application of the principle of home Member State supervision.
