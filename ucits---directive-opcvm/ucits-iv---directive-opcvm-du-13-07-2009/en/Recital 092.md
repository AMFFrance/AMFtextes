(92) Since the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States in so far as they involve the adoption of rules with common features applicable at Community level and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of those rules, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in ArticleÂ 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
