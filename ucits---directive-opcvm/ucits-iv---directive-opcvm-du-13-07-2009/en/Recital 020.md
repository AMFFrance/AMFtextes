(20) The competent authorities that authorise the UCITS should take into account the rules of the common fund or the instruments of incorporation of the investment company, the choice of the depositary and the ability of the management company to manage the UCITS. Where the management company is established in another Member State, the competent authorities should be able to rely on an attestation, issued by the competent authorities of the management company’s home Member State, regarding the type of UCITS that the management company is authorised to manage. Authorisation of a UCITS should not be subject to an additional capital requirement at the level of the management company, the location of the management company’s registered office in the UCITS home Member State, or the location of any activity of the management company in the UCITS home Member State.
