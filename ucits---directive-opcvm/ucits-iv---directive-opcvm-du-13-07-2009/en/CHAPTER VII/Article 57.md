# Article 57 - null


1.   UCITS are not required to comply with the limits laid down in this Chapter when exercising subscription rights attaching to transferable securities or money market instruments which form part of their assets.

While ensuring observance of the principle of risk spreading, Member States may allow recently authorised UCITS to derogate from Articles 52 to 55 for six months following the date of their authorisation.

2.   If the limits referred to in paragraph 1 are exceeded for reasons beyond the control of a UCITS or as a result of the exercise of subscription rights, that UCITS shall adopt as a priority objective for its sales transactions the remedying of that situation, taking due account of the interests of its unit-holders.
