(50) Several Member States have enacted provisions that enable non-coordinated collective investment undertakings to pool their assets in one so-called master fund. In order to allow UCITS to make use of those structures, it is necessary to exempt feeder UCITS wishing to pool their assets in a master UCITS from the prohibition to invest more than 10 % of their assets or, as the case may be, 20 % of their assets in a single collective investment undertaking. Such an exemption is justified as the feeder UCITS invests all or almost all of its assets into the diversified portfolio of the master UCITS, which itself is subject to UCITS diversification rules.
