(28) This Directive concerns those merger techniques which are most commonly used in Member States. It does not require all Member States to introduce all three techniques into their national law, but each Member State should recognise a transfer of assets resulting from those merger techniques. This Directive does not prevent UCITS from using other techniques on a purely national basis, in situations where none of the UCITS concerned by the merger has been notified for cross-border marketing of its units. Those mergers will remain subject to the relevant provisions of national law. National rules on quorum should neither discriminate between national and cross-border mergers, nor be more stringent than those laid down for mergers of corporate entities.
