(51) In order to facilitate the effective operation of the internal market and to ensure the same level of investor protection throughout the Community, master-feeder structures should be allowed both where the master and the feeder are established in the same Member State and where they are established in different Member States. In order to allow investors better to understand master-feeder-structures and regulators to supervise them more easily, notably in a cross-border situation, no feeder UCITS should be able to invest into more than one master. In order to ensure the same level of investor protection throughout the Community the master should itself be an authorised UCITS. In order to avoid an undue administrative burden, provisions on notification of cross-border marketing should not apply if a master UCITS does not raise capital from the public in a Member State other than that in which it is established, but has only one or more feeder UCITS in that other Member State.
