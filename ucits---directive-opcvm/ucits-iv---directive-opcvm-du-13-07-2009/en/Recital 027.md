(27) Despite the need for consolidation between UCITS, mergers of UCITS encounter many legal and administrative difficulties in the Community. It is therefore necessary, in order to improve the functioning of the internal market, to lay down Community provisions facilitating mergers between UCITS (and investment compartments thereof). Although some Member States are likely to authorise only contractual funds, cross-border mergers between all types of UCITS (contractual, corporate and unit trusts) should be permitted and recognised by each Member State without the need for Member States to provide for new legal forms of UCITS in their national law.
