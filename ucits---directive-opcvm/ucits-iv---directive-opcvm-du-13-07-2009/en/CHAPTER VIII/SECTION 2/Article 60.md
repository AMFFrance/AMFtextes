# Article 60 - null


1.   Member States shall require that the master UCITS provide the feeder UCITS with all documents and information necessary for the latter to meet the requirements laid down in this Directive. For this purpose, the feeder UCITS shall enter into an agreement with the master UCITS.

The feeder UCITS shall not invest in excess of the limit applicable under Article 55(1) in units of that master UCITS until the agreement referred to in the first subparagraph has become effective. That agreement shall be made available, on request and free of charge, to all unit-holders.

In the event that both master and feeder UCITS are managed by the same management company, the agreement may be replaced by internal conduct of business rules ensuring compliance with the requirements set out in this paragraph.

2.   The master and the feeder UCITS shall take appropriate measures to coordinate the timing of their net asset value calculation and publication in order to avoid market timing in their units, preventing arbitrage opportunities.

3.   Without prejudice to Article 84, if a master UCITS temporarily suspends the repurchase, redemption or subscription of its units, whether at its own initiative or at the request of its competent authorities, each of its feeder UCITS is entitled to suspend the repurchase, redemption or subscription of its units notwithstanding the conditions laid down in Article 84(2) within the same period of time as the master UCITS.

4.   If a master UCITS is liquidated, the feeder UCITS shall also be liquidated, unless the competent authorities of its home Member State approve:

(a) the investment of at least 85 % of the assets of the feeder UCITS in units of another master UCITS; or

(b) the amendment of its fund rules or instruments of incorporation in order to enable the feeder UCITS to convert into a UCITS which is not a feeder UCITS.

Without prejudice to specific national provisions regarding compulsory liquidation, the liquidation of a master UCITS shall take place no sooner than three months after the master UCITS has informed all of its unit-holders and the competent authorities of the feeder UCITS home Member State of the binding decision to liquidate.

5.   If a master UCITS merges with another UCITS or is divided into two or more UCITS, the feeder UCITS shall be liquidated, unless the competent authorities of the feeder UCITS home Member State grant approval to the feeder UCITS to:

(a) continue to be a feeder UCITS of the master UCITS or another UCITS resulting from the merger or division of the master UCITS;

(b) invest at least 85 % of its assets in units of another master UCITS not resulting from the merger or the division; or

(c) amend its fund rules or its instruments of incorporation in order to convert into a UCITS which is not a feeder UCITS.

No merger or division of a master UCITS shall become effective, unless the master UCITS has provided all of its unit-holders and the competent authorities of its feeder UCITS home Member States with the information referred to, or comparable with that referred to, in Article 43 by 60 days before the proposed effective date.

Unless the competent authorities of the feeder UCITS home Member State has granted approval pursuant to point (a) of the first subparagraph, the master UCITS shall enable the feeder UCITS to repurchase or redeem all units in the master UCITS before the merger or division of the master UCITS becomes effective.

6.   The Commission may adopt implementing measures specifying:

(a) the content of the agreement or of the internal conduct of business rules referred to in paragraph 1;

(b) which measures referred to in paragraph 2 are deemed appropriate; and

(c) the procedures for the required approvals pursuant to paragraphs 4 and 5 in the event of a liquidation, merger or division of a master UCITS.

Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 112(2).
