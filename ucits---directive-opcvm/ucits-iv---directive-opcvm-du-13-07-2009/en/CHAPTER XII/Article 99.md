1.   Member States shall lay down the rules on measures and penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that those rules are enforced. Without prejudice to the procedures for the withdrawal of authorisation or to the right of Member States to impose criminal penalties, Member States shall, in particular, ensure, in conformity with their national law, that the appropriate administrative measures can be taken or administrative penalties be imposed against the persons responsible where the provisions adopted in the implementation of this Directive have not been complied with.

The measures and penalties provided for shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

2.   Without precluding rules on measures and penalties applicable to infringements of the other national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive, Member States shall, in particular, lay down effective, proportionate and dissuasive measures and penalties concerning the duty to present key investor information in a way that is likely to be understood by retail investors according to Article 78(5).

3.   Member States shall allow competent authorities to disclose to the public any measure or penalty that will be imposed for infringement of the provisions adopted in the implementation of this Directive, unless such disclosure would seriously jeopardise the financial markets, be detrimental to the interests of investors or cause disproportionate damage to the parties involved.
