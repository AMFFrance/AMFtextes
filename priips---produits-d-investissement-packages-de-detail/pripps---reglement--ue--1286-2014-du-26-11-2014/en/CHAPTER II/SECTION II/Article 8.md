When developing the draft regulatory technical standards the ESAs shall take into account the various types of PRIIPs, the differences between them and the capabilities of retail investors as well as the features of the PRIIPs so as to allow the retail investor to select between different underlying investments or other options provided for by the product, including where this selection can be undertaken at different points in time, or changed in the future.

The ESAs shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 March 2015.

Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 and of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.
