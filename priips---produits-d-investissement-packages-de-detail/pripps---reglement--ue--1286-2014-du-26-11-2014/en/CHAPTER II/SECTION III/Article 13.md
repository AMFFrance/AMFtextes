# Article 13 - null


1.   A person advising on, or selling, a PRIIP shall provide retail investors with the key information document in good time before those retail investors are bound by any contract or offer relating to that PRIIP.

2.   A person advising on, or selling, a PRIIP may satisfy the requirements of paragraph 1 by providing the key information document to a person with written authority to make investment decisions on behalf of the retail investor in respect of transactions concluded under that written authority.

3.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1 and subject to Article 3(1), point (a) of Article 3(3) and Article 6 of Directive 2002/65/EC, a person selling a PRIIP may provide the retail investor with the key information document after conclusion of the transaction, without undue delay, where all of the following conditions are met:

(a) the retail investor chooses, on his own initiative, to contact the person selling a PRIIP and conclude the transaction using a means of distance communication;

(b) provision of the key information document in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article is not possible;

(c) the person advising on or selling the PRIIP has informed the retail investor that provision of the key information document is not possible and has clearly stated that the retail investor may delay the transaction in order to receive and read the key information document before concluding the transaction;

(d) the retail investor consents to receiving the key information document without undue delay after conclusion of the transaction, rather than delaying the transaction in order to receive the document in advance.

4.   Where successive transactions regarding the same PRIIP are carried out on behalf of a retail investor in accordance with instructions given by that retail investor to the person selling the PRIIP prior to the first transaction, the obligation to provide a key information document under paragraph 1 shall apply only to the first transaction, and to the first transaction after the key information document has been revised in accordance with Article 10.

5.   In order to ensure consistent application of this Article, the ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee, develop draft regulatory technical standards specifying the conditions for fulfilling the requirement to provide the key information document as laid down in paragraph 1.

The ESAs shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 31 December 2015.

Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 and of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.
