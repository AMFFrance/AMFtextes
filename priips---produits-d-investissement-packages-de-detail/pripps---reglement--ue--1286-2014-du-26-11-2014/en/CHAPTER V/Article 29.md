# Article 29 - null


1.   A decision, against which there is no appeal, imposing an administrative sanction or measure for infringements referred to in Article 24(1) shall be published by competent authorities on their official website without undue delay after the person on whom the sanction or measure was imposed has been informed of that decision.

The publication shall include at least the following information:

(a) the type and nature of the infringement;

(b) the identity of the persons responsible.

That obligation does not apply to decisions imposing measures that are of an investigatory nature.

Where the publication of the identity of the legal entities, or identity or personal data of natural persons, is considered by the competent authority to be disproportionate following a case-by-case assessment conducted on the proportionality of the publication of such data, or where such publication would jeopardise the stability of financial markets or an ongoing investigation, the competent authorities shall:

(a) delay the publication of the decision to impose a sanction or a measure until the moment where the reasons for non-publication cease to exist;

(b) publish the decision to impose a sanction or a measure on an anonymous basis in a manner which complies with national law, if such anonymous publication ensures an effective protection of the personal data concerned; or

(c) not publish the decision to impose a sanction or measure in the event that the options laid down in points (a) and (b) are considered to be insufficient to ensure: (i) that the stability of financial markets would not be put in jeopardy; (ii) the proportionality of the publication of such decisions with regard to measures which are deemed to be of a minor nature.

2.   Competent authorities shall inform the ESAs of all administrative sanctions or measures imposed but not published in accordance with point (c) of the third subparagraph of paragraph 1 including any appeal in relation thereto and the outcome thereof.

In the case of a decision to publish a sanction or measure on an anonymous basis the publication of the relevant data may be postponed for a reasonable period of time if it is envisaged that within that period the reasons for anonymous publication will cease to exist.

3.   Where national law provides for the publication of the decision to impose a sanction or measure which is subject to an appeal before the relevant judicial or other authorities, the competent authorities shall publish on their official website, without undue delay, such information and any subsequent information on the outcome of such appeal. Moreover, any decision annulling a previous decision to impose a sanction or a measure which has been published shall also be published.

4.   Competent authorities shall ensure that any publication, in accordance with this Article, shall remain on their official website for a period of at least five years after its publication. Personal data contained in the publication shall be kept on the official website of the competent authority only for the period which is necessary in accordance with the applicable data protection rules.
