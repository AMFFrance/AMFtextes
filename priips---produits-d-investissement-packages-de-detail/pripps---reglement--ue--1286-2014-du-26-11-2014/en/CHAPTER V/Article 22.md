# Article 22 - null


1.   Without prejudice to the supervisory powers of competent authorities and the right of Member States to provide for and impose criminal sanctions, Member States shall lay down rules establishing appropriate administrative sanctions and measures applicable to situations which constitute an infringement of this Regulation and shall take all necessary measures to ensure that they are implemented. Those sanctions and measures shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

Member States may decide not to lay down rules for administrative sanctions as referred to in the first subparagraph for infringements which are subject to criminal sanctions under their national law.

By 31 December 2016 the Member States shall notify the rules referred to in the first subparagraph to the Commission and to the Joint Committee. They shall notify the Commission and the Joint Committee without delay of any subsequent amendment thereto.

2.   In the exercise of their powers in Article 24, competent authorities shall cooperate closely to ensure that the administrative sanctions and measures produce the results pursued by this Regulation and coordinate their action in order to avoid possible duplication and overlap when applying administrative sanctions and measures to cross-border cases.
