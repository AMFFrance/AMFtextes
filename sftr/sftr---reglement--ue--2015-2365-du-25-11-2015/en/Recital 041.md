(41) The application of the transparency requirements laid down in this Regulation should be deferred in order to provide trade repositories with sufficient time to apply for the authorisation and recognition of their activities provided for in this Regulation, and counterparties and collective investment undertakings with sufficient time to comply with those requirements. In particular, it is appropriate to defer the application of additional transparency requirements for collective investment undertakings, taking into account the Guidelines for competent authorities and UCITS management companies issued by ESMA on 18 December 2012 which lay down an optional framework for UCITS management companies regarding disclosure obligations and the need to reduce the administrative burden of managers of collective investment undertakings. In order to ensure the effective implementation of the reporting of SFTs, a phase-in of the application of the requirements by type of counterparty is necessary. Such an approach should take into account the effective ability of the counterparty to comply with the reporting obligations laid down in this Regulation.
