(1) The global financial crisis that emerged in 2007-2008 has revealed excessive speculative activities, important regulatory gaps, ineffective supervision, opaque markets and overly complex products in the financial system. The Union has adopted a range of measures in order to render the banking system more solid and more stable, including strengthening capital requirements, rules on improved governance and supervision and resolution regimes, and to ensure that the financial system fulfils its role in directing capital towards the financing of the real economy. Progress made on the establishment of the banking union is also decisive in this context. However, the crisis has also highlighted the need to improve transparency and monitoring not only in the traditional banking sector but also in areas where bank-like credit intermediation known as ‘shadow banking’, takes place, the scale of which is alarming, having already been estimated to amount to close to half of the regulated banking system. Any shortcomings with regard to those activities, which are similar to those carried out by credit institutions, have the potential to affect the rest of the financial sector.
