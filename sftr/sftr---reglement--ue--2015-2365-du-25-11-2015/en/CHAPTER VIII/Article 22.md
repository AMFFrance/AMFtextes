3.   Where Member States have chosen, in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article, to lay down criminal sanctions for the infringements of the provisions referred to in that paragraph they shall ensure that appropriate measures are in place so that competent authorities have all of the necessary powers to liaise with judicial, prosecuting, or criminal justice authorities within their jurisdiction to receive specific information related to criminal investigations or proceedings commenced for possible infringements of Articles 4 and 15, and to provide such information to other competent authorities and ESMA to fulfil their obligation to cooperate with each other and, where relevant, with ESMA for the purposes of this Regulation.

Competent authorities may cooperate with competent authorities of other Member States and relevant third-country authorities with respect to the exercise of their powers to impose sanctions.

For the purpose of point (g)(i) and (ii) of the first subparagraph, where the legal person is a parent undertaking or a subsidiary of the parent undertaking which has to prepare consolidated financial accounts in accordance with Directive 2013/34/EU, the relevant total annual turnover shall be the total annual turnover or the corresponding type of income according to the relevant accounting regime according to the last available consolidated accounts approved by the management body of the ultimate parent undertaking.

Member States may provide that competent authorities have powers in addition to those referred to in this paragraph. Member States may also provide for a wider scope of sanctions and higher levels of sanctions than those provided for in this paragraph.

5.   An infringement of Article 4 shall not affect the validity of the terms of an SFT or the possibility of the parties to enforce the terms of an SFT. An infringement of Article 4 shall not give rise to compensation rights from a party to an SFT.
