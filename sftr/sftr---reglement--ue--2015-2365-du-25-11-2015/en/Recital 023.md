(23) Although the scope of the rules concerning reuse in this Regulation is wider than that of Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (13), this Regulation does not amend the scope of that Directive but should, rather, be read in addition to that Directive. The conditions subject to which counterparties have a right to reuse and to exercise that right should not in any way diminish the protection afforded to a title transfer financial collateral arrangement under Directive 2002/47/EC. Against that background, any infringement of the transparency requirements of reuse should not affect national law concerning the validity or effect of a transaction.
