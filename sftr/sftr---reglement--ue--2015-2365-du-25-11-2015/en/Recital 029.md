(29) Technical standards in the financial services sector should ensure consistent harmonisation and adequate protection of depositors, investors and consumers across the Union. As a body with highly specialised expertise, it is efficient and appropriate to entrust ESMA with the development of draft regulatory technical and implementing standards which do not involve policy choices. ESMA should ensure efficient administrative and reporting processes when drafting technical standards. The Commission should be empowered to adopt regulatory technical standards by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU and in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 in the following areas: the details to be reported for different types of SFTs; the details of the application for registration or extension of the registration of a trade repository; the details of the procedures to be applied by trade repositories in order to verify the details of SFTs reported to them; the frequency and the details of publication of, the requirements for, and the access to, trade repositoriesâ€™ data; and, if necessary, the further specification of the content of the Annex.
