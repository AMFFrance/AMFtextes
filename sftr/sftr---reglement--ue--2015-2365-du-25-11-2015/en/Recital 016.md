(16) Investments made on the basis of incomplete or inaccurate information as regards a collective investment undertakingâ€™s investment strategy can result in significant investor losses. It is therefore essential that collective investment undertakings disclose all relevant detailed information linked to their use of SFTs and total return swaps. In addition, full transparency is especially relevant in the area of collective investment undertakings as the entirety of assets that are subject to SFTs and total return swaps are not owned by the managers of collective investment undertakings but by their investors. Full disclosure as regards SFTs and total return swaps is therefore an essential tool to safeguard against possible conflicts of interest.
