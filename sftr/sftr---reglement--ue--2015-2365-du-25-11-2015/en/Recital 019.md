(19) In order to enable investors to become aware of the risks associated with the use of SFTs and total return swaps, managers of collective investment undertakings should include detailed information on any recourse they have to those techniques in periodical reports. The existing periodical reports that UCITS management companies or UCITS investment companies and AIFMs have to produce should be supplemented by the additional information on the use of SFTs and total return swaps. In further specifying the content of those periodical reports, ESMA should take into account the administrative burden and the specificities of different types of SFTs and total return swaps.
