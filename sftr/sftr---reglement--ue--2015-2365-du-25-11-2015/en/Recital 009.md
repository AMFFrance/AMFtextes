(9) In order to respond to the issues raised by the FSB Policy Framework and the developments envisaged following structural reform of the Union banking sector, Member States are likely to adopt divergent national measures which could create obstacles to the smooth functioning of the internal market and be to the detriment of market participants and financial stability. In addition, the lack of harmonised transparency rules makes it difficult for national authorities to compare the micro-level data stemming from different Member States and thus to understand the real risks individual market participants pose to the system. It is therefore necessary to prevent such distortions and obstacles from arising in the Union. Consequently, the appropriate legal basis for this Regulation is Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), as interpreted in accordance with the consistent case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.
