(32) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to take decisions on the assessment of the rules of third countries for the purposes of recognising third-country trade repositories, and in order to avoid potentially duplicate or conflicting requirements. The assessment which forms the basis of decisions on equivalence of reporting requirements in a third country should not prejudice the right of a trade repository established in that third country and recognised by ESMA to provide reporting services to entities established in the Union, as a recognition decision should be independent of such an assessment for the purposes of an equivalence decision.
