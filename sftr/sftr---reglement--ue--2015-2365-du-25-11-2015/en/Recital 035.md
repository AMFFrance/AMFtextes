(35) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely enhancing the transparency of certain activities in financial markets such as the use of SFTs and reuse of collateral in order to enable the monitoring and identification of the corresponding risks, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of this Regulation, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
