(4) On 19 March 2012, the Commission published a Green Paper on Shadow Banking. Based on the extensive feedback received and taking into account international developments, the Commission issued, on 4 September 2013, a communication to the Council and the European Parliament entitled ‘Shadow Banking — Addressing New Sources of Risk in the Financial sector’. The Communication stressed that the complex and opaque nature of SFTs makes it difficult to identify counterparties and monitor risk concentration and also leads to the build-up of excessive leverage in the financial system.
