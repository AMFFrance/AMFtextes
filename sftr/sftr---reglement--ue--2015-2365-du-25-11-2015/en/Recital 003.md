(3) On 14 October 2014, the FSB published a regulatory framework for haircuts on non-centrally cleared SFTs. In the absence of clearing, such operations raise major risks if they are not properly collateralised. While enhancing transparency in the reuse of client assets would be a first step towards facilitating counterpartiesâ€™ capacity to analyse and prevent risks, the FSB is due to complete its work, by 2016, on a set of recommendations on haircuts on non-centrally cleared SFTs to prevent excessive leveraging and mitigate concentration risk and default risk.
