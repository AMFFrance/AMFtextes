# Article 11 - Supervisory fees


1.   ESMA shall charge the trade repositories fees in accordance with this Regulation and in accordance with the delegated acts adopted pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article. Those fees shall be proportionate to the turnover of the trade repository concerned and fully cover ESMA’s necessary expenditure relating to the registration, recognition and supervision of trade repositories as well as the reimbursement of any costs that the competent authorities may incur as a result of any delegation of tasks pursuant to Article 9(1) of this Regulation. In so far as Article 9(1) of this Regulation refers to Article 74 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, references to Article 72(3) of that Regulation shall be construed as references to paragraph 2 of this Article.

Where a trade repository has already been registered under Title VI, Chapter 1, of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the fees referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall only be adjusted to reflect additional necessary expenditure and costs relating to the registration, recognition and supervision of trade repositories pursuant to this Regulation.

2.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 30 to specify further the type of fees, the matters for which fees are due, the amount of the fees and the manner in which they are to be paid.
