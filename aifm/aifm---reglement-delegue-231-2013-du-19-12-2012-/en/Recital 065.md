(65) Directive 2011/61/EU requires cross-sectoral consistency and the removal of misalignment between the interests of originators that repackage loans into tradable securities and AIFMs that invest in those securities or other financial instruments on behalf of AIFs. To achieve that aim, the relevant provisions of Directive 2006/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions (7) that lay down the quantitative and qualitative requirements to be met by investors exposed to the credit risk of a securitisation, by originators and by sponsors have been taken into account. As the same objective of aligning the interests of the originator or sponsor and the interests of investors are pursued by this Regulation and the relevant provisions of Directive 2006/48/EC it is essential that the terminology is used consistently in both legal acts, therefore the definitions given in Directive 2006/48/EC are taken as reference. Given that the Committee of European Banking Supervisors, the predecessor of the European Banking Authority, has provided detailed Guidelines for interpreting the relevant provisions of Directive 2006/48/EC (8), achieving cross-sectoral consistency requires the current provisions seeking to align interests between originators, sponsors and AIFMs to be interpreted in light of those Guidelines.
