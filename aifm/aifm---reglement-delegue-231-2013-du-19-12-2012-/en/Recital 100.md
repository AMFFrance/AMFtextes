(100) Depending on the type of assets to be safe-kept, assets are either to be held in custody, as with financial instruments which can be registered in a financial instruments account, or which can be physically delivered to the depositary in accordance with Directive 2011/61/EU, or to be subject to ownership verification and record-keeping. The depositary should hold in custody all financial instruments of the AIF or of the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF that could be registered or held in an account directly or indirectly in the name of the depositary or a third party to whom custody functions are delegated, notably at the level of the central securities depositary. In addition to these situations those financial instruments are to be held in custody that are only directly registered with the issuer itself or its agent in the name of the depositary or a third party to whom custody functions are delegated. Those financial instruments that in accordance with applicable national law are only registered in the name of the AIF with the issuer or its agent, such as investments in non-listed companies by private equity and venture capital funds, should not be held in custody. All financial instruments which could be physically delivered to the depositary should be held in custody. Provided that the conditions on which financial instruments are to be held in custody are fulfilled, financial instruments which are provided as collateral to a third party or are provided by a third party for the benefit of the AIF have to be held in custody too by the depositary itself or by a third party to whom custody functions are delegated as long as they are owned by the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF. Also, financial instruments owned by the AIF or by the AIFM on behalf of the AIF, for which the AIF, or the AIFM on behalf of the AIF, has given its consent to re-use by the depositary, remain in custody as long as the right of re-use has not been exercised.
