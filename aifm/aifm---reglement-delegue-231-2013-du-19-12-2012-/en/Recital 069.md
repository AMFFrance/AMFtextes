(69) In case of a breach of the retention requirement or the qualitative requirements the AIFM should consider taking some corrective action, such as hedging, selling or reducing the exposure or approaching the party in breach of the retention requirement with a view to reinstating compliance. Such corrective action should always be in the interest of the investors and should not involve any direct obligation to sell the assets immediately after the breach has become apparent, therefore avoiding a ‘fire sale’. The AIFM should take the breach into account when considering making another investment in a further transaction in which the party in breach of the requirement is involved.
