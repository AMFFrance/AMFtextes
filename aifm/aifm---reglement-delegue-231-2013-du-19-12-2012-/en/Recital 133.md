(133) A competent authorityâ€™s supervisory powers under Article 25(3) of Directive 2011/61/EU are exercised within the new supervisory system, forming part of what are ongoing supervisory processes and systemic risk assessments of AIFMs by competent authorities and the European supervisory authorities, with reference to the stability and integrity of the financial system. Competent authorities should make appropriate use of the information they receive and should impose limits to leverage employed by an AIFM or other restrictions on the management of the AIF with respect to the AIFs managed where they deem this necessary in order to ensure the stability and integrity of the financial system. The assessment of systemic risk is likely to vary depending on the economic environment, whereby any AIFM, with respect to the AIFs it manages, has the potential to be systemically relevant. It is therefore a basic requirement that competent authorities obtain all the information necessary to assess those situations appropriately in order to avoid the build-up of systemic risk. Competent authorities should then assess the information thoroughly and take appropriate measures.
