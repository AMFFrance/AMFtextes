(52) The risk management policy forms another pillar of the risk management system. That policy should be appropriately documented and should explain, in particular, measures and procedures employed to measure and manage risks, the safeguards for independent performance of the risk management function, the techniques used to manage risks and the details of the allocation of responsibilities within the AIFM for risk management and operating procedures. In order to ensure its effectiveness, the risk management policy should be reviewed at least annually by the senior management.
