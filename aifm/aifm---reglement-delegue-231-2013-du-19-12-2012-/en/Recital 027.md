(27) As the commitment method leads to interest rates with different maturities being considered as different underlying assets, AIFs that according to their core investment policy primarily invest in interest rate derivatives may use specific duration netting rules in order to take into account the correlation between the maturity segments of the interest rate curve. When setting out its investment policy and risk profile, an AIF should be able to define the level of the interest rate risk and consequently to determine its target duration. The AIF should take into account the predefined target duration when making its investment choices. When the portfolio duration diverges from the target duration, the strategy should not be considered as a duration netting arrangement as laid down in the criteria related to the commitment method.
