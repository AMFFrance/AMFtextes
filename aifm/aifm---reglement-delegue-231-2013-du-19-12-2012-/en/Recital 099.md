(99) The depositary has to ensure that all payments made by or on behalf of investors upon the subscription of shares or units of an AIF have been received and booked in one or more cash accounts in accordance with Directive 2011/61/EU. The AIFM should therefore ensure that the depositary is provided with the relevant information it needs to properly monitor the receipt of investors’ payments. The AIFM has to ensure that the depositary obtains this information without undue delay when the third party receives an order to redeem or issue shares or units of an AIF. The information should therefore be transmitted at the close of the business day from the entity which is responsible for the subscription and redemption of shares or units of an AIF to the depositary in order to avoid any misuse of investors’ payments.
