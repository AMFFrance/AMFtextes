(29) Netting positions between two different maturity ranges should be partially allowed. Penalties have to be applied to the netted positions to allow only partial netting. They should be expressed by means of percentages relying on the average correlations between the maturity ranges for two years, five years, 10 years and 30 years of the interest rate curve. The longer the difference between the maturities of the positions, the more their netting must be subject to a penalty, and therefore the percentages must increase.
