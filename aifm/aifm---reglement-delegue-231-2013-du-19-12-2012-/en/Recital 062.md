(62) The stress tests should, where appropriate, simulate shortage of liquidity of the assets as well as atypical redemption requests. Recent and expected future subscriptions and redemptions should be taken into consideration together with the impact of anticipated AIF performance relative to peers on such activity. The AIFM should analyse the period of time required to meet redemption requests in the stress scenarios simulated. The AIFM should also conduct stress tests on market factors such as foreign exchange movements which could materially impact the credit profile of the AIFM or that of the AIF and as a result collateral requirements. The AIFM should account for valuation sensitivities under stressed conditions in its approach to stress testing or scenario analysis.
