(127) With respect to the content and format of the disclosure of remuneration where information is presented at the level of the AIFM, further information should be provided by disclosing an allocation or breakdown of the total remuneration as it relates to the relevant AIF. This could be achieved through disclosure of the total AIFM remuneration data split into fixed and variable components, a statement that these data relate to the entire AIFM, and not to the AIF, the number of AIFs and UCITS funds managed by the AIFM and the total assets under management of such AIFs and UCITS with an overview of the remuneration policy and a reference to where the full remuneration policy of the AIFM is available at the request of investors. Further details may be provided by disclosure of the total variable remuneration funded by the AIF through payment by it of performance fees or carried interest, as the case may be. In addition to the remuneration disclosure, it may be appropriate for AIFMs to provide information relating to the financial and non-financial criteria of the remuneration policies and practices for relevant categories of staff to enable investors to assess existing incentives created.
