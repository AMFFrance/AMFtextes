(3) As the Delegated Regulation specifies the tasks and responsibilities of the ‘governing body’ and of the ‘senior management’ it is important to clarify the meaning of these terms, in particular the fact that a governing body may be comprised of senior managers. Furthermore, as this Regulation introduces also the term ‘supervisory function’ the definition of the governing body should make clear that it is the body which comprises the managerial function in case the supervisory and the managerial functions are separated in accordance with national company law. Directive 2011/61/EU requires AIFMs to provide certain information to competent authorities, including the percentage of the AIF’s assets which are subject to special arrangements arising from their illiquid nature. This Regulation clarifies the meaning of special arrangements so that AIFMs know exactly what information they should provide to competent authorities.
