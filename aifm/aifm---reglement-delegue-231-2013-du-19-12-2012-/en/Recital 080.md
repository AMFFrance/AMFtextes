(80) Calculation of the net asset value per unit or share is subject to national law and, as the case may be, or the fund rules or instruments of incorporation. This Regulation covers only the procedure for the calculation, and not the methodology of the calculation. The AIFM may itself carry out the calculation of the net asset value per unit or share as part of the administration functions it performs for the AIF. Alternatively, a third party may be appointed to perform administration, including calculation of the net asset value. A third party that carries out the calculation of the net asset value for an AIF should not be considered an external valuer for the purposes of Directive 2011/61/EU, as long as it does not provide valuations for individual assets, including those requiring subjective judgement, but incorporates into the calculation process values which are obtained from the AIFM, pricing sources or an external valuer.
