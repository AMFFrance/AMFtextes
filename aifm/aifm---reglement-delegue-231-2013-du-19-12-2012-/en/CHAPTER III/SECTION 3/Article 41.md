(e) the adequacy and effectiveness of measures aiming to ensure the functional and hierarchical separation of the risk management function in accordance with Article 42.

The frequency of the periodic review referred to in the first subparagraph shall be decided by the senior management in accordance with the principle of proportionality given the nature, scale and complexity of the AIFM’s business and the AIF it manages.
