# Article 44 - Risk limits


1.   An AIFM shall establish and implement quantitative or qualitative risk limits, or both, for each AIF it manages, taking into account all relevant risks. Where only qualitative limits are set, the AIFM shall be able to justify this approach to the competent authority.

2.   The qualitative and quantitative risk limits for each AIF shall, at least, cover the following risks:

(a) market risks;

(b) credit risks;

(c) liquidity risks;

(d) counterparty risks;

(e) operational risks.

3.   When setting risk limits, the AIFM shall take into account the strategies and assets employed in respect of each AIF it manages as well as the national rules applicable to each of those AIFs. Those risk limits shall be aligned with the risk profile of the AIF as disclosed to investors in accordance with point (c) of Article 23(4) of Directive 2011/61/EU and approved by the governing body.
