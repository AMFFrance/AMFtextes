# Article 48 - Liquidity management limits and stress tests


1.   AIFMs shall, where appropriate, considering the nature, scale and complexity of each AIF they manage, implement and maintain adequate limits for the liquidity or illiquidity of the AIF consistent with its underlying obligations and redemption policy and in accordance with the requirements laid down in Article 44 relating to quantitative and qualitative risk limits.

AIFMs shall monitor compliance with those limits and where limits are exceeded or likely to be exceeded, they shall determine the required (or necessary) course of action. In determining appropriate action, AIFMs shall consider the adequacy of the liquidity management policies and procedures, the appropriateness of the liquidity profile of the AIF’s assets and the effect of atypical levels of redemption requests.

2.   AIFMs shall regularly conduct stress tests, under normal and exceptional liquidity conditions, which enable them to assess the liquidity risk of each AIF under their management. The stress tests shall:

(a) be conducted on the basis of reliable and up-to-date information in quantitative terms or, where this is not appropriate, in qualitative terms;

(b) where appropriate, simulate a shortage of liquidity of the assets in the AIF and atypical redemption requests;

(c) cover market risks and any resulting impact, including on margin calls, collateral requirements or credit lines;

(d) account for valuation sensitivities under stressed conditions;

(e) be conducted at a frequency which is appropriate to the nature of the AIF, taking in to account the investment strategy, liquidity profile, type of investor and redemption policy of the AIF, and at least once a year.

3.   AIFMs shall act in the best interest of investors in relation to the outcome of any stress tests.
