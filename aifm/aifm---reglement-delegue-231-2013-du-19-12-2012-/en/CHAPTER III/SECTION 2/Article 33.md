# Article 33 - Procedures and measures preventing or managing conflicts of interest


1.   The procedures and measures established for the prevention or management of conflicts of interest shall be designed to ensure that the relevant persons engaged in different business activities involving a risk of conflict of interest carry out these activities having a degree of independence which is appropriate to the size and activities of the AIFM and of the group to which it belongs, and to the materiality of the risk of damage to the interests of the AIF or its investors.

2.   Where necessary and appropriate for the AIFM to ensure the requisite degree of independence, the procedures to be followed and measures to be adopted in accordance with point (b) of Article 31(2) shall include the following:

(a) effective procedures to prevent or control the exchange of information between relevant persons engaged in collective portfolio management activities or other activities pursuant to Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 2011/61/EU involving a risk of conflict of interest where the exchange of information may harm the interest of one or more AIFs or their investors;

(b) the separate supervision of relevant persons, whose principal functions involve carrying out collective portfolio management activities on behalf of, or providing services to, clients or investors, whose interests may conflict, or who otherwise represent different interests that may conflict, including those of the AIFM;

(c) the removal of any direct link between the remuneration of relevant persons principally engaged in one activity and the remuneration of, or revenues generated by, different relevant persons principally engaged in another activity, where a conflict of interest may arise in relation to those activities;

(d) measures to prevent or restrain any person from exercising inappropriate influence over the way in which a relevant person carries out collective portfolio management activities;

(e) measures to prevent or control the simultaneous or sequential involvement of a relevant person in separate collective portfolio management activities or other activities pursuant to Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 2011/61/EU where such involvement may impair the proper management of conflicts of interest.

Where the adoption or the application of one or more of those measures and procedures does not ensure the requisite degree of independence, the AIFM shall adopt such alternative or additional measures and procedures as are necessary and appropriate for those purposes.
