(a) with reference to the activities carried out by or on behalf of the AIFM, including activities carried out by a delegate, sub-delegate, external valuer or counterparty, identification of the circumstances which constitute or may give rise to a conflict of interest entailing a material risk of damage to the interests of the AIF or its investors;

(b) procedures to be followed and measures to be adopted in order to prevent, manage and monitor such conflicts.
