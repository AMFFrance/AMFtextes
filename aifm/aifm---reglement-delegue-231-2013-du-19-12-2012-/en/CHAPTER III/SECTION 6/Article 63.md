1.   For any relevant person who is involved in activities that may give rise to a conflict of interest, or who has access to inside information within the meaning of Article 1(1) of Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on insider dealing and market manipulation (market abuse) (10) or to other confidential information relating to an AIF or transactions with or for an AIF, an AIFM shall establish, implement and maintain adequate arrangements aimed at preventing such relevant persons from:

(a) entering into a personal transaction in financial instruments or other assets which fulfils one of the following criteria: (i) the transaction is subject to Article 2(1) of Directive 2003/6/EC; (ii) the transaction involves the misuse or improper disclosure of confidential information; (iii) the transaction conflicts or is likely to conflict with an obligation of the AIFM under Directive 2011/61/EU;

(b) advising or inducing, other than in the proper course of his employment or contract for services, any other person to enter into a personal transaction referred to in point (a)(i) and (ii), or that would otherwise constitute a misuse of information relating to pending orders;

(c) disclosing, other than in the normal course of his employment or contract for services and without prejudice to Article 3(a) of Directive 2003/6/EC, any information or opinion to any other person if the relevant person knows, or reasonably ought to know, that as a result of that disclosure that other person would or would be likely to take either of the following steps: (i) entering into a personal transaction referred to in point (a)(i) and (ii) in financial instruments or other assets or that would otherwise constitute a misuse of information relating to pending orders; (ii) advising or inducing another person to enter into such a personal transaction.

2.   The arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 shall in particular be designed to ensure that:

(a) each relevant person is aware of the restrictions on personal transactions referred to in paragraph 1, and of the measures established by the AIFM in connection with personal transactions and disclosure, pursuant to paragraph 1;

(b) the AIFM is informed promptly of any personal transaction entered into by a relevant person covered by paragraph 1, either by notification of that transaction or by other procedures enabling the AIFM to identify such transactions;

(c) a record is kept of the personal transaction notified to the AIFM or identified by it, including any authorisation or prohibition in connection with such a transaction.

For the purposes of point (b) of the first subparagraph, where certain activities of the AIFM are performed by third parties, the AIFM shall ensure that the entity performing the activity maintains a record of personal transactions entered into by any relevant person covered by paragraph 1 and provides that information to the AIFM promptly on request.

3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to personal transactions:

(a) effected under a discretionary portfolio management service where there is no prior communication in connection with the transaction between the portfolio manager and the relevant person or other person for whose account the transaction is executed;

(b) in UCITS or AIFs that are subject to supervision under the law of a Member State which requires an equivalent level of risk spreading in their assets, where the relevant person and any other person for whose account the transactions are effected are not involved in the management of that undertaking.

4.   For the purpose of paragraph 1, a personal transaction shall also include a transaction in a financial instrument or other asset effected on behalf or for the account of:

(a) a relevant person;

(b) any person with whom the relevant person has a family relationship or with whom the relevant person has close links;

(c) a person whose relationship with the relevant person is such that the relevant person has a direct or indirect material interest in the outcome of the trade, other than a fee or commission for the execution of the trade.
