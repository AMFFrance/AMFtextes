(61) The use of minimum limits regarding the liquidity or illiquidity of the AIF could provide an effective monitoring tool for certain types of AIFMs. Exceeding a limit may not of itself require action by the AIFM as this depends on the facts and circumstances and the tolerances set by the AIFM. Limits could thus be used in practice in relation to monitoring average daily redemption versus fund liquidity in terms of days over the same period. That could also be used to monitor investor concentration to support stress testing scenarios. Those limits could provide triggers for continued monitoring or remedial action depending on the circumstances.
