(96) The assessment of the law of the third country according to Article 21(6) last subparagraph of Directive 2011/61/EU should be made by the European Commission by comparing the authorisation criteria and the ongoing operating conditions applicable to the depositary in the third country with the corresponding requirements applicable under Union law to credit institutions and, as the case may be, or to investment firms for access to the depositary business and performance of the depositary functions, with a view to ascertaining whether the local criteria have the same effect as those established under Union law. A depositary which is subject to prudential oversight and licensed in the third country under a local category other than a credit institution or an investment firm may be assessed by the European Commission with a view to ascertaining whether the relevant provisions of the law of the third country have the same effect as those established by the law of the Union for credit institutions and, as the case may be, or for investment firms.
