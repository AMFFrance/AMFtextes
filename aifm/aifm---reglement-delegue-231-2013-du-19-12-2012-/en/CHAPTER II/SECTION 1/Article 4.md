# Article 4 - Occasional breach of the threshold


1.   The AIFM shall assess situations where the total value of assets under management exceeds the relevant threshold in order to determine whether or not they are of a temporary nature.

2.   Where the total value of assets under management exceeds the relevant threshold and the AIFM considers that the situation is not of a temporary nature, the AIFM shall notify the competent authority without delay stating that the situation is considered not to be of a temporary nature and shall seek authorisation within 30 calendar days in accordance with Article 7 of Directive 2011/61/EU.

3.   Where the total value of assets under management exceeds the relevant threshold and the AIFM considers that the situation is of a temporary nature, the AIFM shall notify the competent authority without delay, stating that the situation is considered to be of a temporary nature. The notification shall include supporting information to justify the AIFM’s assessment of the temporary nature of the situation, including a description of the situation and an explanation of the reasons for considering it temporary.

4.   A situation shall not be considered of a temporary nature if it is likely to continue for a period in excess of three months.

5.   Three months after the date on which the total value of assets under management exceeds the relevant threshold the AIFM shall recalculate the total value of assets under management in order to demonstrate that it is below the relevant threshold or demonstrate to the competent authority that the situation which resulted in the assets under management exceeding the threshold has been resolved and an application for authorisation of the AIFM is not required.
