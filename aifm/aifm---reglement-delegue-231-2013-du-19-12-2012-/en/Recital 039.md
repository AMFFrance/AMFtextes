(39) Directive 2011/61/EU requires AIFMs to act in the best interests of AIFs, the investors in the AIFs and the integrity of the market. AIFMs should therefore apply appropriate policies and procedures which allow them to prevent malpractices such as market timing or late trading. Market timers take advantage of out of date or stale prices for portfolio securities that impact the calculation of AIF’s net asset value (NAV) or buy and redeem units of the AIF within a few days, thereby exploiting the way the AIF calculates its NAV. Late trading involves placing of orders to buy or redeem units of AIFs after a designated cut off point but the price received is the one of the cut off point. Both malpractices harm the interests of long term investors as they dilute their return and have detrimental effects on AIF’s returns as they increase transaction costs and disrupt portfolio management. AIFMs should also establish appropriate procedures to ensure that the AIF is managed efficiently and should act in such a way as to prevent undue costs being charged to the AIF and its investors.
