(113) The depositaryâ€™s liability under Article 21(12) second subparagraph of Directive 2011/61/EU is triggered in the event of the loss of a financial instrument held in custody by the depositary itself or by a third party to whom the custody has been delegated, provided that the depositary does not demonstrate that the loss results from an external event beyond reasonable control, the consequences of which would have been unavoidable despite all reasonable efforts to the contrary. That loss should be distinguished from an investment loss for investors resulting from a decrease in the value of assets as a consequence of an investment decision.
