(126) With respect to the content and format of the report on activities for the financial year which has to be part of the annual report under Directive 2011/61/EU, the report should include a fair and balanced review of the activities of the AIF with a description of the principal risks and investments or economic uncertainties that it faces. That disclosure should not result in the publication of proprietary information of the AIF which would be to the detriment of the AIF and its investors. Therefore, if the publication of particular proprietary information would have such effect, it could be aggregated to a level that would avoid the detrimental effect and would not need to capture, for example, the performance or statistics of an individual portfolio company or investment that could lead to the disclosure of proprietary information of the AIF. This information should form part of the management report in so far as this is usually presented alongside the financial statements.
