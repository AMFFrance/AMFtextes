(15) In addition to calculating exposure using the gross method, all AIFMs should calculate exposure using the commitment method. According to the commitment method financial derivative instruments should be converted into equivalent positions in the underlying asset. However, if an AIF invests in certain derivatives in order to off-set the market risk of other assets in which the AIF is invested, under certain conditions, those derivatives should not be converted into an equivalent position in the underlying assets as the exposures of the two investments balance one another. That should be the case where, for instance, an AIF portfolio invests in a certain index and holds a derivative instrument which swaps the performance of that index with the performance of a different index, that should be equivalent to holding exposure to the second index in the portfolio and therefore the AIFâ€™s net asset value would not depend on the performance of the first index.
