(121) A depositary is allowed under certain circumstances to discharge itself of liability for the loss of financial instruments held in custody by a third party to which custody was delegated. For such liability discharge to be permitted there must be an objective reason for contracting such discharge that is accepted by both the depositary and the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF. An objective reason should be established for each discharge of liability taking into account the concrete circumstances in which custody has been delegated.
