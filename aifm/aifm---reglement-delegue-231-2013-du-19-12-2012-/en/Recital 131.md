(131) Directive 2011/61/EU requires AIFMs to provide certain information on a regular basis to the competent authority of their home Member State for each EU AIFs they manage and for each of the AIF they market in the Union. It is therefore important to further specify the information to be provided and the frequency of the reporting which depend on the value of assets under management in portfolios of AIFs managed by a given AIFM. Pro-forma reporting templates should be provided for and should be completed by the AIFM for the AIFs it manages. Where an entity which is authorised as an AIFM markets AIFs which are managed by other AIFMs, it does not act as the manager of those AIFs but as an intermediary as any investment firm covered by Directive 2004/39/EC. It therefore should not have to report for these AIFs, as this would lead to double- or multiple reporting. This reporting requirement should nevertheless apply to non-EU AIFMs that manage AIFs which are marketed in the Union.
