(101) Financial instruments which are held in custody should be subject to due care and protection at all times. To ensure that the custody risk is properly assessed, in exercising due care, the depositary should in particular know which third parties constitute the custody chain, ensure that the due-diligence and segregation obligations have been maintained throughout the whole custody chain, ensure that it has an appropriate right of access to the books and records of third parties to whom custody functions are delegated, ensure compliance with these requirements, document all of these duties and make these documents available to and report to the AIFM.
