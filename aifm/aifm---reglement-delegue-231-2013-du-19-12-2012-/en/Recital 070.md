(70) In order to comply with the requirements of Directive 2011/61/EU to specify internal procedures and organisational arrangements, which each AIFM should apply, AIFMs should be required to establish a well-documented organisational structure that clearly assigns responsibilities, defines control mechanisms and ensures a good flow of information between all parties involved. AIFMs should also establish systems to safeguard information and ensure business continuity. When establishing those procedures and structures, AIFMs should take into account the principle of proportionality which allows procedures, mechanisms and organisational structure to be calibrated to the nature, scale and complexity of the AIFMâ€™s business and to the nature and range of activities carried out in the course of its business.
