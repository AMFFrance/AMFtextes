(48) The conflicts of interest policy established by the AIFM should identify situations in which activities carried out by the AIFM could constitute conflicts of interest that do or do not lead to potential risks of damage to the AIFâ€™s interests or the interests of its investors. To identify them the AIFM should take into account not only the activity of collective portfolio management but also other activities it is authorised to carry out, including activities of its delegates, sub-delegates, external valuer or counterparty.
