(110) The depositary should ensure that the income is calculated accurately in accordance with Directive 2011/61/EU. In order to achieve this the depositary has to ensure that the income distribution is appropriate and, where it identifies an error, that the AIFM takes appropriate remedial action. Once the depositary has ensured this, it should verify the completeness and accuracy of the income distribution and in particular of the dividend payments.
