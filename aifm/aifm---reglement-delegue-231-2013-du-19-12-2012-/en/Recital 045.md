(45) Investors in AIFs should benefit from protection similar to that of AIFM clients to whom AIFMs provide the service of individual portfolio management, as in such a case they have to comply with the best execution rules laid down in Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments amending Council Directives 85/611/EEC and 93/6/EEC and Directive 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directive 93/22/EEC (4) and Directive 2006/73/EC. However, the differences between the various types of assets in which AIFs are invested should be taken into account, since best execution is not relevant, for instance, when the AIFM invests in real estate or partnership interests and the investment is made after extensive negotiations on the terms of the agreement. Where there is no choice of different execution venues, the AIFM should be able to demonstrate to the competent authorities and auditors that there is no choice of different execution venues.
