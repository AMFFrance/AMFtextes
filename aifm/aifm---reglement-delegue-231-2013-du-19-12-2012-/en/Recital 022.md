(22) A portfolio management practice which aims to offset the risk of a given share by taking a short position through a derivative contract on a share that is different to but strongly correlated with that first share should not be considered as complying with the hedging criteria. Although such a strategy relies on taking opposite positions on the same asset class, it does not hedge the specific risk linked to the investment in a certain share. Therefore, it should not be considered as a hedging arrangement as laid down in the criteria related to the commitment method.
