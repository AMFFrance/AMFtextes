(2) It is important to ensure that the objectives of Directive 2011/61/EU are achieved uniformly throughout the Member States, to enhance the integrity of the internal market and offer legal certainty for its participants, including institutional investors, competent authorities and other stakeholders, by adopting a Regulation. The form of a Regulation ensures a coherent framework for all market operators and is the best possible guarantee for a level playing field, uniform conditions of competition and the common appropriate standard of investor protection. Furthermore it ensures the direct applicability of detailed uniform rules concerning the operation of AIFMs, which by their nature are directly applicable and therefore require no further transposition at national level. The recourse to a regulation allows, in addition, to avoid a delayed application of Directive 2011/61/EU in the Member States.
