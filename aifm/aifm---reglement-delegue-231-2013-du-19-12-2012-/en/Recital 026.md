(26) When using methods which increase the exposure of an AIF, the AIFM should observe general principles such as considering the substance of the transaction in addition to its legal form. Specifically with respect to repurchase transactions, the AIFM should consider whether the risks and rewards of the assets involved are passed or retained by the AIF. The AIFM should also look through derivative instruments or other contractual arrangements to the underlying assets to determine the possible future commitments of the AIF resulting from those transactions.
