(68) There are circumstances in which entities meet the definition of originator or sponsor, or fulfil the role of original lender; however, another entity that neither meets the definition of sponsor or originator, nor fulfils the role of original lender — but whose interests are most optimally aligned with those of investors — may seek to fulfil the retention requirement. For the sake of legal certainty, such other entity should not be required to fulfil the retention requirement if the retention requirement is fulfilled by the originator, sponsor or original lender.
