(67) The requirements that need to be met by institutions acting as originators, sponsors or original lenders of a securitisation are directly imposed on them by way of Directive 2006/48/EC. It is therefore important to prescribe the corresponding duties of an AIFM assuming exposure to securitisations. Consequently, the AIFM should assume exposure to securitisations only if the originator, sponsor or original lender has explicitly disclosed to the AIFM the retention of a significant economic interest in the underlying asset, known as retention requirement. Furthermore, the AIFM should ensure that various qualitative requirements imposed on the sponsor and originator through Directive 2006/48/EC are met. In addition, the AIFM should itself meet qualitative requirements in order to have a comprehensive and thorough understanding of the securitisation investment and its underlying exposure. To achieve that, AIFMs should make their investment decision only after having conducted careful due diligence from which they should have adequate information on and knowledge of the securitisations concerned.
