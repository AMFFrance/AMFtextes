(66) It is important that transactions that re-package loans into tradable securities are not structured in such a way as to avoid the application of the requirements relating to investments in securitisation positions. Therefore, the reference to an investment in tradable securities or other financial instruments based on repackaged loans should not be interpreted strictly as a legally valid and binding transfer of title with respect to such instruments, but as an investment made in a material economic sense so that any other forms of synthetic investments should be covered and subject to the specific requirements. To avoid misunderstandings and align the language with that used in the banking legislation, the terms ‘assumption of exposure to the credit risk of a securitisation’ should be used instead of ‘investment in tradable securities or other financial instruments based on repackaged loans’.
