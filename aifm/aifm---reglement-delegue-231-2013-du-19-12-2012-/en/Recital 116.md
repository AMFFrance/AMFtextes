(116) No loss can be ascertained when the financial instrument has been substituted by or converted into another financial instrument, for example in situations where shares are cancelled and replaced by the issue of new shares in a company reorganisation. An AIF should not be considered as permanently deprived of its right of ownership over the financial instrument if the AIF or the AIFM acting on behalf of the AIF has legitimately transferred ownership to a third party. Where there is a distinction between the legal ownership and the beneficial ownership of the assets, the definition of loss should refer to loss of the beneficial ownership right.
