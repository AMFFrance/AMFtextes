(12) In order to receive appropriate information for monitoring systemic risks and to gain a complete picture of the use of leverage by the AIFM, information about the exposure of an AIF should be provided to competent authorities and investors both on a gross and on a commitment method basis and all AIFMs should therefore calculate exposure using both the gross and the commitment method. The gross method gives the overall exposure of the AIF whereas the commitment method gives insight in the hedging and netting techniques used by the manager; therefore both methods shall be seen in conjunction. Specifically, the degree to which overall exposure differs between the gross method and the commitment method may provide useful information. If necessary to ensure that any increase of the exposure of AIFs is adequately reflected the Commission may adopt additional delegated acts on an additional and optional method for the calculation of leverage.
