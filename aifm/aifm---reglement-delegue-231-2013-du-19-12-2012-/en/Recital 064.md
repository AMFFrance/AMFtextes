(64) Directive 2011/61/EU requires the Commission to specify how the investment strategy, liquidity profile and redemption policy are to be aligned. The consistency between those three elements is ensured if investors are able to redeem their investments in accordance with the AIF redemption policy, which should cover conditions for redemption in both normal and exceptional circumstances, and in a manner consistent with the fair treatment of investors.
