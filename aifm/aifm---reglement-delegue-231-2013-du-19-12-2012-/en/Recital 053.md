(53) As required by Directive 2011/61/EU, the function of risk management should be functionally and hierarchically separated from the operating units. It should thus be clarified that such separation should be ensured up to the governing body of the AIFM and that those in the risk management function should not carry out any conflicting tasks or be supervised by someone who is in charge of conflicting functions.
