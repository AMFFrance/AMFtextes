(51) One of the central components of a risk management system is a permanent risk management function. In the interest of consistency, its tasks and responsibilities should be similar in nature to those assigned by Commission Directive 2010/43/EU of 1 July 2010 implementing Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards organisational requirements, conflicts of interest, conduct of business, risk management and content of the agreement between a depositary and a management company (6) to the permanent risk management function in UCITS management companies. This function should have a primary role in shaping the risk policy of the AIF, risk monitoring and risk measuring in order to ensure that the risk level complies on an ongoing basis with the AIF’s risk profile. The permanent risk management function should have the necessary authority, access to all relevant information and regular contacts with the senior management and the governing body of the AIFM in order to provide them with updates so that they can take prompt remedial action where needed.
