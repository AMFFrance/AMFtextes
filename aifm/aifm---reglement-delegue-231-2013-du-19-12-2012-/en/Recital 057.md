(57) Directive 2011/61/EU requires the Commission to specify the liquidity management systems and procedures enabling the AIFM to monitor the liquidity risk of the AIF, except where the AIF is an un-leveraged closed-ended AIF, and ensure that the liquidity profile of the AIFâ€™s investments complies with its underlying obligations. Therefore, it is important to set out fundamental general requirements addressed to all AIFMs, the application of which should be adapted to the size, structure and nature of the AIFs managed by the AIFM concerned.
