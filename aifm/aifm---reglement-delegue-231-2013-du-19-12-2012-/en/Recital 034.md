(34) In line with their risk management obligations, AIFMs should have appropriate qualitative internal control mechanisms to avoid or mitigate operational failures, including professional liability risks. Therefore, an AIFM should have, as part of its risk management policy, adequate policies and procedures for operational risk management, appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of its business. Such procedures and policies should in any event enable an internal loss database to be built up to serve for the purpose of assessing the operational risk profile.
