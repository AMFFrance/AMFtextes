(5) It is important to clarify the relationship between the procedure for those AIFMs which choose to opt in and the revocation of an authorisation granted to AIFMs under Directive 2011/61/EU. An AIFM granted authorisation under Directive 2011/61/EU whose assets under management subsequently fall below the thresholds set out in Article 3(2) of Directive 2011/61/EU remains authorised and subject to the application of that Directive in its entirety as long as the authorisation is not revoked. The revocation of the authorisation should not be automatically triggered by a fall of the assets under management of an authorised AIFM below the relevant threshold, but only at the request of the AIFM. Consequently it should not be possible for an AIFM to request to opt in as long as it holds an authorisation under Directive 2011/61/EU, whereas an AIFM whose authorisation has been revoked upon its request should still be able to seek to opt in again under Directive 2011/61/EU.
