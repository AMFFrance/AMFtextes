(1) In the situations referred to in point (b), point (c)(i), points (e) and (f) and point (g)(i) of Article 37(4) of Directive 2011/61/EU, more than one Member State could be considered as a possible Member State of reference of a non-EU manager of alternative investment funds (AIFMs) intending to manage EU alternative investment funds (AIFs) and, as the case may be, or market AIFs managed by it in the Union. In those cases the non-EU AIFM has to submit a request to the competent authorities of those Member States to determine its Member State of reference. The request should be accompanied by all the relevant information and documentation necessary for determining the Member State of reference for this AIFM. A joint decision should be adopted by the competent authorities concerned to determine the Member State of reference. A procedure to be followed by the relevant competent authorities when determining the Member State of reference needs to be established. Whilst the appointment of the Member State of reference is the joint responsibility of the competent authorities of the Member States concerned, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) should ensure that all possible Member States of reference are duly involved in such decision-making and should assist in reaching an agreement.
