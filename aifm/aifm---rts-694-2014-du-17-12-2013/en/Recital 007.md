(7) For the purposes of Article 61(3) and (4) of Directive 2011/61/EU account should be taken of the legal structures under which closed-ended AIFs were established before 22 July 2013. When the Directive was adopted no harmonised definition existed in the Union regarding the legal structure of closed-ended AIFs, which varied between Member States. This reality is reflected in the text of the Directive, which qualifies as closed-ended AIFs certain existing legal structures that have no redemption rights exercisable during the period of 5 years from the date of the initial investment. Article 61(3) and (4) of Directive 2011/61/EU provides for transitional periods during which existing AIFMs, in so far as they manage closed-ended AIFs that are in an advanced or final stage of their investment cycle, as evidenced by their expiring date or by their impossibility to make any additional investment after 22 July 2013, can continue to manage such AIFs without authorisation or without having to comply with a significant part of the Directive. Consequently, in order to preserve the scope of those provisions as intended in light of this objective and the above mentioned background, it should be also considered to be an AIFM of a closed-ended AIF for the purposes of Article 61(3) and (4) of Directive 2011/61/EU, each AIFM in so far it manages AIFs whose shares or units are repurchased or redeemed after an initial period of at least 5 years during which redemption rights are not exercisable.
