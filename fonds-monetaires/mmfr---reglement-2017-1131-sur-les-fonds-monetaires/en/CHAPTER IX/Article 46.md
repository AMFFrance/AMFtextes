# Article 46 - Review


1.   By 21 July 2022, the Commission shall review the adequacy of this Regulation from a prudential and economic point of view, following consultations with ESMA and, where appropriate, the ESRB, including whether changes are to be made to the regime for public debt CNAV MMFs and LVNAV MMFs.

2.   The review shall in particular:

(a) analyse the experience acquired in applying this Regulation, the impact on investors, MMFs and the managers of MMFs in the Union;

(b) assess the role that MMFs play in purchasing debt issued or guaranteed by the Member States;

(c) take into account the specific characteristics of the debt issued or guaranteed by the Member States and the role that the debt plays in financing the Member States;

(d) take into account the report referred to in Article 509(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;

(e) take into account the impact of this Regulation on the short-term financing markets;

(f) take into account the regulatory developments at international level.

By 21 July 2022, the Commission shall present a report on the feasibility of establishing an 80 % EU public debt quota. That report shall have regard to the availability of short-term EU public debt instruments and assess whether LVNAV MMFs might be an appropriate alternative to non-EU public debt CNAV MMFs. If the Commission concludes in the report that the introduction of an 80 % EU public debt quota and the phasing out of public debt CNAV MMFs that include an unlimited amount of non-EU public debt are not feasible, it should present the reasons for that. In the event that the Commission concludes that the introduction of an 80 % EU public debt quota is feasible, the Commission may make legislative proposals to introduce such a quota, whereby at least 80 % of the assets of public debt CNAV MMFs are to be invested in EU public debt instruments. In addition, if the Commission concludes that LVNAV MMFs have become an appropriate alternative to non-EU public debt CNAV MMFs, it may make appropriate proposals to remove the derogation for public debt CNAV MMFs altogether.

The results of the review shall be communicated to the European Parliament and to the Council, accompanied, where necessary, by appropriate proposals for amendments.
