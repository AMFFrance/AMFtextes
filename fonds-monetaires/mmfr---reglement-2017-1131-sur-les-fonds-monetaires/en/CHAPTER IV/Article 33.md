# Article 33 - Issue and redemption price


1.   The units or shares of an MMF shall be issued or redeemed at a price that is equal to the MMF's NAV per unit or share, notwithstanding permitted fees or charges as specified in the prospectus of the MMF.

2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1:

(a) the units or shares of a public debt CNAV MMF may be issued or redeemed at a price that is equal to that MMF's constant NAV per unit or share;

(b) the units or shares of a LVNAV MMF may be issued or redeemed at a price that is equal to that MMF's constant NAV per unit or share, but only where the constant NAV per unit or share calculated in accordance with Article 32(1), (2) and (3) does not deviate from the NAV per unit or share calculated in accordance with Article 30 by more than 20 basis points.

In relation to point (b), when the constant NAV per unit or share calculated in accordance with Article 32(1), (2) and (3) deviates from the NAV per unit or share calculated in accordance with Article 30 by more than 20 basis points, the following redemption or subscription shall be undertaken at a price that is equal to the NAV per unit or share calculated in accordance with Article 30.

Potential investors shall, prior to the conclusion of the contract, be clearly warned in writing by the manager of an MMF of the circumstances in which the LVNAV MMF will no longer redeem or subscribe at a constant NAV per unit or share.
