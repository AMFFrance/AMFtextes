3.   A collective investment undertaking that is an AIF and that requires authorisation as an MMF under this Regulation shall be authorised as an MMF pursuant to the authorisation procedure laid down in Article 5.

4.   No collective investment undertaking shall be authorised as an MMF unless the competent authority of the MMF is satisfied that the MMF will be able to meet all the requirements of this Regulation.

5.   For the purposes of authorisation as an MMF, a collective investment undertaking shall submit to its competent authority all of the following documents:

(a) the fund rules or instruments of incorporation of the MMF, including an indication of which type of MMF it is from those set out in Article 3(1);

(b) identification of the manager of the MMF;

(e) a description of, or any information on, the arrangements and procedures needed to comply with the requirements referred to in Chapters II to VII;

(f) any other information or document requested by the competent authority of the MMF to verify compliance with the requirements of this Regulation.

6.   The competent authorities shall, on a quarterly basis, inform ESMA of authorisations granted or withdrawn pursuant to this Regulation.

The register shall be made available in electronic format.
