(b) the market value of the assets received as part of the reverse repurchase agreement is at all times at least equal to the value of the cash paid out.

2.   The assets received by an MMF as part of a reverse repurchase agreement shall be money market instruments that fulfil the requirements set out in Article 10.

The assets received by an MMF as part of a reverse repurchase agreement shall not be sold, reinvested, pledged or otherwise transferred.

4.   The assets received by an MMF as part of a reverse repurchase agreement shall be sufficiently diversified with a maximum exposure to a given issuer of 15 % of the MMF's NAV, except where those assets take the form of money market instruments that fulfil the requirements of Article 17(7). In addition, the assets received by an MMF as part of a reverse repurchase agreement shall be issued by an entity that is independent from the counterparty and is expected not to display a high correlation with the performance of the counterparty.
