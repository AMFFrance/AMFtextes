(a) the targeted MMF is authorised under this Regulation;

(b) where the targeted MMF is managed, whether directly or under a delegation, by the same manager as that of the acquiring MMF or by any other company to which the manager of the acquiring MMF is linked by common management or control, or by a substantial direct or indirect holding, the manager of the targeted MMF, or that other company, is prohibited from charging subscription or redemption fees on account of the investment by the acquiring MMF in the units or shares of the targeted MMF;

(c) where an MMF invests 10 % or more of its assets in units or shares of other MMFs: (i) the prospectus of that MMF shall disclose the maximum level of the management fees that may be charged to the MMF itself and to the other MMFs in which it invests; and (ii) the annual report shall indicate the maximum proportion of management fees charged to the MMF itself and to the other MMFs in which it invests.
