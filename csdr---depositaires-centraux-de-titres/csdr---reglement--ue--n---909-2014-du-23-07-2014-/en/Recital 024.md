(24) Where a CSD provides its services in a Member State other than the Member State where it is established, including through setting up a branch, the competent authority of its home Member State is mainly responsible for the supervision of that CSD. When the activities of a CSD in a host Member State have become of substantial importance for the functioning of the securities markets and the protection of the investors in that host Member State, the competent authorities and relevant authorities of the home Member State and of the host Member State should establish cooperation arrangements for the supervision of the activities of that CSD in the host Member State. The competent authority of the home Member State should also be able to decide that those cooperation arrangements envisage multilateral cooperation, including cooperation of a collegial nature, between the competent authority of the home Member State and the competent authorities and relevant authorities of the host Member States concerned. Such cooperation arrangements, however, should not be considered to be colleges of supervisors as referred to in Regulation (EU) NoÂ 1095/2010. No Member State or group of Member States should be discriminated against directly or indirectly, as a location for CSD and settlement services. While performing its duties under this Regulation no authority should directly or indirectly discriminate against any undertaking from another Member State. Subject to this Regulation, a CSD from one Member State should not be restricted in or prevented from settling financial instruments in the currency of another Member State or in the currency of a third country.
