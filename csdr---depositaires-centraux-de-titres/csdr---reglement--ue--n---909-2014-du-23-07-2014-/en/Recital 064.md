(64) In order to detect potential infringements, effective mechanisms to encourage reporting of potential or actual infringements of this Regulation to the competent authorities should be put in place. Those mechanisms should include adequate safeguards for the persons who report potential or actual infringements of this Regulation and the persons accused of such infringements. Appropriate procedures should be established to comply with the accused personâ€™s right to protection of personal data, with the right of defence and to be heard before the adoption of a final decision affecting that person as well as with the right to seek effective remedy before a tribunal against any decision or measure affecting that person.
