(9) The members of the ESCB, any other bodies performing similar functions in certain Member States or other public bodies charged with or intervening in the management of the public debt in the Union may themselves provide a number of services, such as operating a securities settlement system, which would qualify them as a CSD. Such entities, when acting as CSDs without establishing a separate entity, should be exempt from the authorisation and supervision requirements, certain organisational requirements and capital and investment policy requirements, but should remain subject to the remaining prudential requirements for CSDs. Where such Member State entities act as CSDs, they should not provide their services in other Member States. Since the members of the ESCB act as settlement agents for the purpose of settlement, they should also be exempt from the requirements set out in Title IV of this Regulation.
