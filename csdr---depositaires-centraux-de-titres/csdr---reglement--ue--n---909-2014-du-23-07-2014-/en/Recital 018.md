(18) It is appropriate to allow SME growth markets the flexibility not to apply the buy-in process until up to 15 days after the trade has taken place so as to take into account the liquidity of such markets and to allow, in particular, for activity by market-makers in those less liquid markets. The settlement discipline measures specific to SME growth markets should apply only to transactions executed on such markets. As identified in the Commission Staff Working Paper of 7 December 2011 accompanying the Commission communication entitled, ‘An action plan to improve access to finance for SMEs’, access to capital markets should be developed as an alternative to bank lending to SMEs and it is therefore appropriate to tailor the rules to better serve the needs of those SME growth markets.
