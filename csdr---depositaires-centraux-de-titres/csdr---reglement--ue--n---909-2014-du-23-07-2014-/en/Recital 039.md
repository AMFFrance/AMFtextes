(39) This Regulation should not prevent Member States allowing direct securities holding systems from providing in their national law that parties other than CSDs shall or may perform certain functions, which in some other types of securities holding systems are typically performed by CSDs and specifying how those functions should be exercised. In particular, in some Member States account operators or participants in the securities settlement systems operated by CSDs record entries into securities accounts maintained by CSDs without necessarily being account providers themselves. In view of the need for legal certainty on the entries made into accounts at the CSD level, the specific role played by such other parties should be recognised by this Regulation. It should therefore be possible, under specific circumstances and subject to strict rules laid down by law, to share the responsibility between a CSD and the relevant other party or to provide for exclusive responsibility by that other party for certain aspects related to maintaining of securities accounts at the top tier level provided that such other party is subject to appropriate regulation and supervision. There should be no restrictions on the extent to which responsibility is shared.
