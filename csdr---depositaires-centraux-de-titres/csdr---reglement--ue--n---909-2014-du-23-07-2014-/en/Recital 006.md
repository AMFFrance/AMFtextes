(6) On 20 October 2010, the Financial Stability Board called for more robust core market infrastructures and asked for the revision and enhancement of the existing standards. In April 2012, the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems (CPSS) of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) adopted global standards for financial market infrastructures. Those standards have replaced the BIS recommendations of 2001, which were adapted through non-binding guidelines at European level in 2009 by the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and the Committee of European Securities Regulators. Taking into account the global nature of financial markets and the systemic importance of CSDs, it is necessary to ensure international convergence of the prudential requirements to which they are subject. This Regulation should follow the existing principles for financial market infrastructures developed by CPSS-IOSCO. The Commission and the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (‘ESMA’), established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), in close cooperation with the members of the ESCB, should ensure consistency with the existing standards and their future developments when drawing up or proposing to revise the regulatory technical standards and the implementing technical standards as well as the guidelines and recommendations referred to in this Regulation.
