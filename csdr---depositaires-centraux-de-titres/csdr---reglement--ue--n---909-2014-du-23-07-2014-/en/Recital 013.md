(13) Longer settlement periods for transactions in transferable securities cause uncertainty and increased risk for securities settlement systems participants. Different durations of settlement periods across Member States hamper reconciliation and are sources of errors for issuers, investors and intermediaries. It is therefore necessary to provide a common settlement period which would facilitate the identification of the intended settlement date and facilitate the implementation of settlement discipline measures. The intended settlement date of transactions in transferable securities which are executed on trading venues regulated by Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 should be no later than on the second business day after the trading takes place. For complex operations composed of several transactions such as securities repurchase or lending agreements, that requirement should apply to the first transaction involving a transfer of securities. Given their non-standardised character, that requirement should not apply to transactions that are negotiated privately by the relevant parties, but executed on the trading venues regulated by Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 or to transactions that are executed bilaterally, but reported to a trading venue regulated by Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014. Moreover, that requirement should not apply to the first transaction where the transferable securities concerned are subject to initial recording in book-entry form.
