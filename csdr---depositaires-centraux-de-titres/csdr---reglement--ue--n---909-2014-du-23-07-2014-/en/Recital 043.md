(43) Directive 98/26/EC provides that transfer orders entered into securities settlement systems in accordance with the rules of those systems should be legally enforceable and binding on third parties. However, since Directive 98/26/EC does not specifically refer to CSDs that operate securities settlement systems, for clarity, this Regulation should require CSDs to define the moment or moments when transfer orders are entered into their systems and become irrevocable in accordance with the rules of that Directive. In addition, in order to increase legal certainty, CSDs should disclose to their participants the moment when the transfer of securities and cash in a securities settlement system is legally enforceable and binding on third parties in accordance, as the case may be, with national law. CSDs should also take all reasonable steps to ensure that transfers of securities and cash are legally enforceable and binding on third parties no later than at the end of the business day of the actual settlement date.
