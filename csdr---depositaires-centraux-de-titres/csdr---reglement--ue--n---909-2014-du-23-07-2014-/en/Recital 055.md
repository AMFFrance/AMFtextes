(55) In order to allow competent authorities to supervise the activities of CSDs effectively, CSDs should be subject to strict record-keeping requirements. CSDs should maintain for at least 10 years all the records and data on all the services that they may provide, including transaction data on collateral management services that involve the processing of securities repurchase or lending agreements. CSDs might need to specify a common format in which their clients provide transaction data so as to allow this record-keeping requirement to be met, in conformity with any relevant regulatory and implementing technical standards adopted under this Regulation.
