(58) The European Code of Conduct for Clearing and Settlement of 7 November 2006 created a voluntary framework to enable access between CSDs and other market infrastructures. However, the post-trade sector remains fragmented along national lines, making cross-border trade unnecessarily costly. It is necessary to lay down uniform conditions for links between CSDs and of access between CSDs and other market infrastructures. In order to enable CSDs to offer their participants access to other markets, they should have a right to become a participant in another CSD or request another CSD to develop special functions for having access to the latter. Such access should be granted on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and should be refused only where it threatens the smooth and orderly functioning of the financial markets or causes systemic risk. A quick and appropriate remedy should be made available to competent authorities to address any unjustified refusal of a CSD to grant access to another CSD. Where CSD links introduce significant risks for settlement, they should be subject to authorisation and increased supervision by the relevant competent authorities.
