(36) Convergence in the fields of crisis prevention, management and resolution, including funding mechanisms, is necessary in order to ensure that public authorities are able to resolve failing financial institutions whilst minimising the impact of failures on the financial system, reliance on taxpayer funds to bail out insurance or reinsurance undertakings and the use of public sector resources, limiting damage to the economy, and coordinating the application of national resolution measures. In this regard, the Commission should be able to request the Authority to contribute to the assessment referred to in ArticleÂ 242 of Directive 2009/138/EC, in particular as regards the cooperation of supervisory authorities within, and functionality of, the colleges of supervisors; the supervisory practices concerning setting the capital add-ons; the assessment of the benefit of enhancing group supervision and capital management within a group of insurance or reinsurance undertakings, including possible measures to enhance the sound cross-border management of insurance groups, notably in respect of risks and assets; and reporting on any new developments and progress concerning a set of coordinated national crisis management arrangements, including the necessity or otherwise of a system of coherent and credible funding mechanisms, with appropriate financing instruments.
