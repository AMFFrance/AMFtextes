5.   The provisions of this Regulation are without prejudice to the powers of the Commission, in particular under Article 258 TFEU, to ensure compliance with Union law.

6.   The objective of the Authority shall be to protect the public interest by contributing to the short, medium and long-term stability and effectiveness of the financial system, for the Union economy, its citizens and businesses. The Authority shall contribute to:

(a) improving the functioning of the internal market, including in particular a sound, effective and consistent level of regulation and supervision,

(b) ensuring the integrity, transparency, efficiency and orderly functioning of financial markets,

(c) strengthening international supervisory coordination,

(d) preventing regulatory arbitrage and promoting equal conditions of competition,

(e) ensuring the taking of risks related to insurance, reinsurance and occupational pensions activities is appropriately regulated and supervised, and

(f) enhancing customer protection.

For those purposes, the Authority shall contribute to ensuring the consistent, efficient and effective application of the acts referred to in paragraph 2, foster supervisory convergence, provide opinions to the European Parliament, the Council, and the Commission and undertake economic analyses of the markets to promote the achievement of the Authority’s objective.

In the exercise of the tasks conferred upon it by this Regulation, the Authority shall pay particular attention to any potential systemic risk posed by financial institutions, the failure of which may impair the operation of the financial system or the real economy.

When carrying out its tasks, the Authority shall act independently and objectively and in the interest of the Union alone.
