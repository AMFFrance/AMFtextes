(56) Improving the exchange of information between FIUs within the Union is particularly important in addressing the transnational character of money laundering and terrorist financing. The use of secure facilities for the exchange of information, in particular the decentralised computer network FIU.net (the ‘FIU.net’) or its successor and the techniques offered by FIU.net, should be encouraged by Member States. The initial exchange of information between FIUs relating to money laundering or terrorist financing for analytical purposes which is not further processed or disseminated should be permitted unless such exchange of information would be contrary to fundamental principles of national law. The exchange of information on cases identified by FIUs as possibly involving tax crimes should be without prejudice to the exchange of information in the field of taxation in accordance with Council Directive 2011/16/EU (15) or in accordance with international standards on the exchange of information and administrative cooperation in tax matters.
