(36) In the case of agency or outsourcing relationships on a contractual basis between obliged entities and external persons not covered by this Directive, any AML/CFT obligations upon those agents or outsourcing service providers as part of the obliged entities could arise only from the contract between the parties and not from this Directive. Therefore the responsibility for complying with this Directive should remain primarily with the obliged entity.
