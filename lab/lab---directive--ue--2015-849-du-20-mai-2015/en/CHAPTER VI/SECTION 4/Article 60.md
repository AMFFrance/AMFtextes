# Article 60 - null


1.   Member States shall ensure that a decision imposing an administrative sanction or measure for breach of the national provisions transposing this Directive against which there is no appeal shall be published by the competent authorities on their official website immediately after the person sanctioned is informed of that decision. The publication shall include at least information on the type and nature of the breach and the identity of the persons responsible. Member States shall not be obliged to apply this subparagraph to decisions imposing measures that are of an investigatory nature.

Where the publication of the identity of the persons responsible as referred to in the first subparagraph or the personal data of such persons is considered by the competent authority to be disproportionate following a case-by-case assessment conducted on the proportionality of the publication of such data, or where publication jeopardises the stability of financial markets or an on-going investigation, competent authorities shall:

(a) delay the publication of the decision to impose an administrative sanction or measure until the moment at which the reasons for not publishing it cease to exist;

(b) publish the decision to impose an administrative sanction or measure on an anonymous basis in a manner in accordance with national law, if such anonymous publication ensures an effective protection of the personal data concerned; in the case of a decision to publish an administrative sanction or measure on an anonymous basis, the publication of the relevant data may be postponed for a reasonable period of time if it is foreseen that within that period the reasons for anonymous publication shall cease to exist;

(c) not publish the decision to impose an administrative sanction or measure at all in the event that the options set out in points (a) and (b) are considered insufficient to ensure: (i) that the stability of financial markets would not be put in jeopardy; or (ii) the proportionality of the publication of the decision with regard to measures which are deemed to be of a minor nature.

2.   Where Member States permit publication of decisions against which there is an appeal, competent authorities shall also publish, immediately, on their official website such information and any subsequent information on the outcome of such appeal. Moreover, any decision annulling a previous decision to impose an administrative sanction or a measure shall also be published.

3.   Competent authorities shall ensure that any publication in accordance with this Article shall remain on their official website for a period of five years after its publication. However, personal data contained in the publication shall only be kept on the official website of the competent authority for the period which is necessary in accordance with the applicable data protection rules.

4.   Member States shall ensure that when determining the type and level of administrative sanctions or measures, the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including where applicable:

(a) the gravity and the duration of the breach;

(b) the degree of responsibility of the natural or legal person held responsible;

(c) the financial strength of the natural or legal person held responsible, as indicated for example by the total turnover of the legal person held responsible or the annual income of the natural person held responsible;

(d) the benefit derived from the breach by the natural or legal person held responsible, insofar as it can be determined;

(e) the losses to third parties caused by the breach, insofar as they can be determined;

(f) the level of cooperation of the natural or legal person held responsible with the competent authority;

(g) previous breaches by the natural or legal person held responsible.

5.   Member States shall ensure that legal persons can be held liable for the breaches referred to in Article 59(1) committed for their benefit by any person, acting individually or as part of an organ of that legal person, and having a leading position within the legal person based on any of the following:

(a) power to represent the legal person;

(b) authority to take decisions on behalf of the legal person; or

(c) authority to exercise control within the legal person.

6.   Member States shall also ensure that legal persons can be held liable where the lack of supervision or control by a person referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article has made it possible to commit one of the breaches referred to in Article 59(1) for the benefit of that legal person by a person under its authority.
