# Article 46 - null


1.   Member States shall require that obliged entities take measures proportionate to their risks, nature and size so that their employees are aware of the provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive, including relevant data protection requirements.

Those measures shall include participation of their employees in special ongoing training programmes to help them recognise operations which may be related to money laundering or terrorist financing and to instruct them as to how to proceed in such cases.

Where a natural person falling within any of the categories listed in point (3) of Article 2(1) performs professional activities as an employee of a legal person, the obligations in this Section shall apply to that legal person rather than to the natural person.

2.   Member States shall ensure that obliged entities have access to up-to-date information on the practices of money launderers and financers of terrorism and on indications leading to the recognition of suspicious transactions.

3.   Member States shall ensure that, where practicable, timely feedback on the effectiveness of and follow-up to reports of suspected money laundering or terrorist financing is provided to obliged entities.

4.   Member States shall require that, where applicable, obliged entities identify the member of the management board who is responsible for the implementation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
