(38) By way of derogation from the general prohibition against carrying out suspicious transactions, obliged entities should be able to carry out suspicious transactions before informing the competent authorities where refraining from such carrying out is impossible or likely to frustrate efforts to pursue the beneficiaries of a suspected money laundering or terrorist financing operation. This, however, should be without prejudice to the international obligations accepted by the Member States to freeze without delay funds or other assets of terrorists, terrorist organisations or those who finance terrorism, in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.
