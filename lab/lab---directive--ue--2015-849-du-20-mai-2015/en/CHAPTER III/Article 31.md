# Article 31 - null


1.   Member States shall require that trustees of any express trust governed under their law obtain and hold adequate, accurate and up-to-date information on beneficial ownership regarding the trust. That information shall include the identity of:

(a) the settlor;

(b) the trustee(s);

(c) the protector (if any);

(d) the beneficiaries or class of beneficiaries; and

(e) any other natural person exercising effective control over the trust.

2.   Member States shall ensure that trustees disclose their status and provide the information referred to in paragraph 1 to obliged entities in a timely manner where, as a trustee, the trustee forms a business relationship or carries out an occasional transaction above the thresholds set out in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 11.

3.   Member States shall require that the information referred to in paragraph 1 can be accessed in a timely manner by competent authorities and FIUs.

4.   Member States shall require that the information referred to in paragraph 1 is held in a central register when the trust generates tax consequences. The central register shall ensure timely and unrestricted access by competent authorities and FIUs, without alerting the parties to the trust concerned. It may also allow timely access by obliged entities, within the framework of customer due diligence in accordance with Chapter II. Member States shall notify to the Commission the characteristics of those national mechanisms.

5.   Member States shall require that the information held in the central register referred to in paragraph 4 is adequate, accurate and up-to-date.

6.   Member States shall ensure that obliged entities do not rely exclusively on the central register referred to in paragraph 4 to fulfil their customer due diligence requirements as laid down in Chapter II. Those requirements shall be fulfilled by using a risk-based approach.

7.   Member States shall ensure that competent authorities and FIUs are able to provide the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4 to the competent authorities and to the FIUs of other Member States in a timely manner.

8.   Member States shall ensure that the measures provided for in this Article apply to other types of legal arrangements having a structure or functions similar to trusts.

9.   By 26 June 2019, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council assessing the conditions and the technical specifications and procedures for ensuring safe and efficient interconnection of the central registers. Where appropriate, that report shall be accompanied by a legislative proposal.
