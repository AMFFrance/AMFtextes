(59) The importance of combating money laundering and terrorist financing should result in Member States laying down effective, proportionate and dissuasive administrative sanctions and measures in national law for failure to respect the national provisions transposing this Directive. Member States currently have a diverse range of administrative sanctions and measures for breaches of the key preventative provisions in place. That diversity could be detrimental to the efforts made in combating money laundering and terrorist financing and the Union's response is at risk of being fragmented. This Directive should therefore provide for a range of administrative sanctions and measures by Member States at least for serious, repeated or systematic breaches of the requirements relating to customer due diligence measures, record-keeping, reporting of suspicious transactions and internal controls of obliged entities. The range of sanctions and measures should be sufficiently broad to allow Member States and competent authorities to take account of the differences between obliged entities, in particular between credit institutions and financial institutions and other obliged entities, as regards their size, characteristics and the nature of the business. In transposing this Directive, Member States should ensure that the imposition of administrative sanctions and measures in accordance with this Directive, and of criminal sanctions in accordance with national law, does not breach the principle of ne bis in idem.
