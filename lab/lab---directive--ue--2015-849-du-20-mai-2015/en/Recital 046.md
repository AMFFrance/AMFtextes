(46) The rights of access to data by the data subject are applicable to the personal data processed for the purpose of this Directive. However, access by the data subject to any information related to a suspicious transaction report would seriously undermine the effectiveness of the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. Exceptions to and restrictions of that right in accordance with Article 13 of Directive 95/46/EC and, where relevant, Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001, may therefore be justified. The data subject has the right to request that a supervisory authority referred to in Article 28 of Directive 95/46/EC or, where applicable, the European Data Protection Supervisor, check the lawfulness of the processing and has the right to seek a judicial remedy referred to in Article 22 of that Directive. The supervisory authority referred to in Article 28 of Directive 95/46/EC may also act on an ex-officio basis. Without prejudice to the restrictions to the right to access, the supervisory authority should be able to inform the data subject that all necessary verifications by the supervisory authority have taken place, and of the result as regards the lawfulness of the processing in question.
