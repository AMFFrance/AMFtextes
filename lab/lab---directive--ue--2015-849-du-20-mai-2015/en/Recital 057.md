(57) In order to be able to respond fully and rapidly to enquiries from FIUs, obliged entities need to have in place effective systems enabling them to have full and timely access through secure and confidential channels to information about business relationships that they maintain or have maintained with specified persons. In accordance with Union and national law, Member States could, for instance, consider putting in place systems of banking registries or electronic data retrieval systems which would provide FIUs with access to information on bank accounts without prejudice to judicial authorisation where applicable. Member States could also consider establishing mechanisms to ensure that competent authorities have procedures in place to identify assets without prior notification to the owner.
