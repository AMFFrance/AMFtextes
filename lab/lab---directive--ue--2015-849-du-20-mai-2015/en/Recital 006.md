In order to increase vigilance and mitigate the risks posed by such cash payments, persons trading in goods should be covered by this Directive to the extent that they make or receive cash payments of EUR 10Â 000 or more. Member States should be able to adopt lower thresholds, additional general limitations to the use of cash and further stricter provisions.
